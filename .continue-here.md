# Aether - Session Handoff

## Current Status

**Project**: Aether Queen Ant Colony - First emergent LLM agent colony with meta-learning

**Current Branch**: `test-aether-system`

**Latest Commit**: `c90a736 fix: complete meta-learning integration with Worker Ant castes`

**Status**: Meta-learning integration now complete and working

---

## What Was Just Completed

### Meta-Learning Integration Fix ✅

**Issue**: Worker Ant derived classes didn't accept `meta_learner` parameter

**Fixed Classes**:
1. `MapperAnt` - Now accepts `meta_learner`
2. `PlannerAnt` - Now accepts `meta_learner`
3. `ExecutorAnt` - Now accepts `meta_learner`
4. `VerifierAnt` - Now accepts `meta_learner`
5. `ResearcherAnt` - Now accepts `meta_learner`
6. `SynthesizerAnt` - Now accepts `meta_learner`

**Commit**: `c90a736`

## System Architecture

```
QueenAntSystem
├── MetaLearner - Bayesian confidence for spawning ✅
├── TripleLayerMemory - Working → Short-term → Long-term
├── Colony (6 Worker Ant castes with meta-learning) ✅
├── PheromoneLayer - INIT, FOCUS, REDIRECT, FEEDBACK
├── PhaseEngine - State machine orchestration
└── ErrorLedger - Pattern flagging
```

### Meta-Learning Flow

```
Spawn Trigger
    ↓
1. Analyze task requirements (_categorize_task)
    ↓
2. Get meta-learner recommendation (Bayesian confidence)
    ↓
3. Fall back to rule-based mapping if no recommendation
    ↓
4. Record spawn event with event_id
    ↓
Task Completion
    ↓
5. Record outcome (SUCCESS/FAILURE, quality, innovation)
    ↓
6. Bayesian update: alpha += success, beta += failure
    ↓
7. Update generalization matrix
    ↓
8. Check for taxonomy evolution (deprecate poor performers)
```

## Testing Results

✅ Demo runs successfully: `python3 .aether/demo.py`

```
✅ Colony initialized
   Features: autonomous_spawning, state_machine_orchestration,
             checkpointing, state_recovery, error_prevention,
             semantic_communication, triple_layer_memory

✅ Worker Ant Castes Available:
   🐜 Mapper Ant - Explores and maps codebase
   🐜 Planner Ant - Creates execution plans
   🐜 Executor Ant - Implements tasks
   🐜 Verifier Ant - Validates implementation
   🐜 Researcher Ant - Gathers information
   🐜 Synthesizer Ant - Combines research results
```

## Important Note

**This is now a Claude-native system** - The `/ant:*` commands are implemented as Claude prompts/skills, not Python CLI commands. Users interact with Aether through the Claude Code interface using `/ant:*` commands.

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Meta-Learning End-to-End
Create a test scenario that exercises the meta-learning loop:
1. Initialize with a goal
2. Execute phases
3. Record task outcomes
4. Verify Bayesian updates occur

### Option 2: Continue Enhancing Meta-Learning
- Add user feedback loop integration
- Implement cross-task generalization detection
- Add taxonomy evolution triggers

### Option 3: Merge to Main
If testing is satisfactory, merge to `main` branch

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run demo
python3 .aether/demo.py

# Run memory demo
python3 .aether/memory_demo.py

# Check git status
git status

# Switch back to main
git checkout main
```

---

## Files Modified This Session

- `.aether/worker_ants.py` - Added `meta_learner` parameter to all Worker Ant `__init__` methods

---

## Summary

The meta-learning integration is now complete. The Worker Ant classes properly accept and pass through the `meta_learner` parameter, enabling:

1. Bayesian confidence scoring for specialist spawning decisions
2. Task outcome recording for continuous learning
3. Autonomous specialist spawning with intelligent recommendations

The system is ready for further testing or merging to main.
