| 27 | Bug Fixes & Safety Foundation | 2 | PASSED | 5/5 truths |

**Score: 6/6 phases passed, 35/35 observable truths verified**

All phases have VERIFICATION.md files. No unverified phases. No critical gaps in any phase.

## Cross-Phase Integration

22 cross-phase data flows verified. No broken connections.

### Major Data Flow Chains

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Mode propagation | colonize (P29 sets) -> COLONY_STATE.json -> build (P29 reads at 5 points) -> auto-continue (P28 delegates) | CONNECTED |
| Activity log continuity | build (P27 cp+>> fix) -> activity.log -> tech debt report (P30 reads) | CONNECTED |
| Error phase attribution | error-add (P27 4th arg) -> errors.json -> tech debt report (P30 reads) | CONNECTED |
| Decision logging | build (P27 Step 5b-post, 5.5) -> memory.json -> tech debt report (P30 reads) | CONNECTED |
| Spawn tree | worker specs (P31 SPAWN REQUEST) -> build (P31 parse+fulfill) -> COLONY_STATE.json -> validate-state | CONNECTED |
| Two-tier learning | continue (P31 promote) -> ~/.aether/learnings.json -> colonize (P31 inject) -> FEEDBACK pheromones | CONNECTED |

### Step Numbering

- **build.md** (modified in 5 phases): No collisions. Steps 1-7f with sub-steps 5c.e2, 5c.f2, 5c.g, 5c.h, 5c.i, 5c.j
- **continue.md** (modified in 3 phases): No collisions. Steps 0-9 with sub-steps 2.5, 2.5b, 2.5c
- **colonize.md** (modified in 4 phases): No collisions. Steps 1-8 with sub-steps 2.5, 4.5, 4-LITE, 5.5

### Pheromone Sensitivity Tables

4 sources cross-checked (build.md x2, pheromones.md, worker specs). All values consistent. pheromones.md correctly omits INIT column (not user-emittable).

### SPAWN REQUEST Format

Identical format across all 6 worker specs, correctly parsed by build.md Step 5c.e2.

**Score: 22/22 connections verified**

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| New project | /ant:colonize -> /ant:plan -> /ant:build -> /ant:continue | COMPLETE |
| Auto-continue | /ant:colonize -> /ant:plan -> /ant:build -> /ant:continue --all | COMPLETE |
| Returning project | /ant:resume-colony -> /ant:continue -> /ant:build | COMPLETE |
| Maintenance | /ant:organize | COMPLETE |

**Score: 3/3 major flows (4 variants) verified end-to-end**

## Shared State Coherence

| State File | Writers (v4.4) | Readers (v4.4) | New Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| COLONY_STATE.json | colonize (mode), build (spawn_tree) | build (5 reads), continue, organize | mode, mode_set_at, mode_indicators, spawn_tree |
| pheromones.json | colonize (global:inject FEEDBACK), build/continue (auto pheromones) | All commands via pheromone-batch | FEEDBACK with source "global:inject" |
| errors.json | build (error-add with phase) | continue (phase filter, tech debt) | phase field on errors |
| memory.json | build (decisions with phase+type) | continue (decisions, learnings) | phase field, type field on decisions |
| activity.log | build (append with phase headers) | continue (tech debt), organize | Append-only continuity (P27 fix) |
| ~/.aether/learnings.json | continue (learning-promote) | colonize (learning-inject) | Entire file (new in P31) |

All state files maintain coherent reader/writer contracts with no orphaned fields.

## Constraint Compliance

| Constraint | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| No new worker spec files | SATISFIED | Reviewer reuses watcher-ant.md, debugger reuses builder-ant.md, archivist reuses architect-ant.md |
| Shell utilities thin | SATISFIED (at boundary) | aether-utils.sh is 369 lines (limit was ~370) |
| JSON state persistence | SATISFIED | All new state via existing .aether/data/*.json + ~/.aether/learnings.json |
| Hybrid architecture | SATISFIED | Prompts for reasoning, shell for deterministic ops |
| No external dependencies | SATISFIED | bash+jq only |
| Command count | DEVIATION (justified) | 14 files vs 12+1 baseline; organize.md added per FLOW-02 requirement |

## Tech Debt

4 items across the milestone. None are blockers.

### Phase 32: Polish & Safety Rails
- **pheromones.md source tag mismatch**: Documentation says global learning FEEDBACK source is `auto:colonize` but implementation uses `global:inject`. The implementation value is more precise. Low impact — no command currently filters by source tag.

### Phase 29: Colony Intelligence
- **validate-state missing mode fields**: `validate-state colony` does not check `mode`, `mode_set_at`, or `mode_indicators`. These are optional fields with null/missing fallback in build.md. Low impact — structural integrity checks cover the critical fields.

### Global
- **Command count deviation**: 14 command files vs stated constraint of 12. The /ant:organize command was explicitly required by FLOW-02 and approved in Phase 32 planning. The constraint predates v4.4 requirements.
- **aether-utils.sh at capacity**: 369/370 lines. Future utility additions will require either raising the limit or extracting helpers. No immediate impact.

## Anti-Patterns

No TODO, FIXME, placeholder, or stub patterns found in any modified file across all 6 phases. One mention of "TODO/FIXME/HACK" in organize.md is instructional (telling the archivist what to scan for in the codebase).

## Audit Verdict

**PASSED.** All 24 requirements satisfied. All 6 phases verified. All cross-phase data flows connected. All E2E user flows complete. 4 minor tech debt items — none blocking.
