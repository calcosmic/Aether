# Milestone v5.1: System Simplification

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 33-40
**Total Plans:** 22

## Overview

Transform Aether from a 7,400-line over-engineered system to a lean 1,800-line implementation based on the M4L-AnalogWave postmortem findings. The postmortem identified that 70% of context was consumed by framework overhead, state fell out of sync at context boundaries, and mathematical models (Bayesian, exponential decay) added complexity without value.

## Phases

### Phase 33: State Foundation
**Goal**: Single COLONY_STATE.json replaces 6 distributed state files
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v5.1)
**Plans**: 4 plans

- [x] 33-01: Schema design and migration script
- [x] 33-02: Update init.md and status.md
- [x] 33-03: Update signal and read-only commands
- [x] 33-04: Update remaining complex commands

### Phase 34: Core Command Rewrite
**Goal**: build.md and continue.md rewritten with state updates at start-of-next-command
**Depends on**: Phase 33
**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 34-01: Rewrite build.md with minimal state write pattern
- [x] 34-02: Rewrite continue.md with detection and reconciliation
- [x] 34-03: Verify build/continue integration and polish

### Phase 35: Worker Simplification
**Goal**: Six worker specs collapsed into single workers.md (~200 lines)
**Depends on**: Phase 34
**Plans**: 2 plans

- [x] 35-01: Create consolidated workers.md with all 6 roles
- [x] 35-02: Update commands and delete old worker files

### Phase 36: Signal Simplification
**Goal**: Pheromone system uses simple TTL instead of exponential decay
**Depends on**: Phase 35
**Plans**: 5 plans

- [x] 36-01: Update signal emission commands with TTL schema
- [x] 36-02: Update signal consumption commands with TTL filtering
- [x] 36-03: Remove pheromone math from utilities and update docs
- [x] 36-04: (gap closure) Remove decay commands from runtime/aether-utils.sh
- [x] 36-05: (gap closure) Update plan/organize/colonize commands, delete runtime/workers/*.md

### Phase 37: Command Trim & Utilities
**Goal**: Remaining commands shrunk and aether-utils.sh reduced to ~80 lines
**Depends on**: Phase 36
**Plans**: 4 plans

- [x] 37-01: Reduce signal commands (focus, redirect, feedback) to ~40 lines each
- [x] 37-02: Reduce status.md to ~80 lines with quick-glance output
- [x] 37-03: Reduce colonize.md to ~150 lines with surface scan pattern
- [x] 37-04: Reduce aether-utils.sh to ~80 lines and sync command directories

### Phase 38: Signal Schema Unification
**Goal**: Fix init.md to use TTL signal schema and ensure all signal paths are consistent
**Depends on**: Phase 37
**Gap Closure**: Addresses audit integration gaps #3, flow gaps #1 and #2
**Plans**: 1 plan

- [x] 38-01: Update init.md signal schema and unify signal paths across all commands

### Phase 39: Worker Reference Consolidation
**Goal**: Update all commands to reference consolidated workers.md instead of individual worker files
**Depends on**: Phase 38
**Gap Closure**: Addresses audit integration gap #2
**Plans**: N/A (work completed in Phase 35-02)

### Phase 40: State & Utility Alignment
**Goal**: Complete state consolidation and sync utility scripts
**Depends on**: Phase 39
**Gap Closure**: Addresses audit integration gaps #1, #4, #5, flow gap #3
**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 40-01: Remove legacy utility calls from commands, update ant.md docs
- [x] 40-02: Sync ~/.aether/aether-utils.sh with runtime version
- [x] 40-03: (gap closure) Remove non-existent function calls, unify signal schema

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Postmortem-driven simplification — reduce from 7,400 to 1,800 lines
- Follow postmortem implementation order (state first, then commands)
- Preserve nested structure (plan, memory, errors) for semantic clarity
- Events as pipe-delimited strings per SIMP-01 requirement
- Build writes only EXECUTING state before workers
- SUMMARY.md existence as primary completion signal (passive detection)
- Signal keywords instead of sensitivity tables
- phase_end as default signal expiration (not wall-clock based)
- Priority levels (high/normal/low) replace numeric strength
- Filter expired signals on read (no cleanup command needed)
- Single-pass surface scan replaces multi-colonizer spawning

**Issues Resolved:**
- State fell out of sync at context boundaries (fixed with start-of-next-command pattern)
- 70% context consumed by framework overhead (reduced to ~20%)
- Mathematical models added complexity without value (removed Bayesian, exponential decay)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None (stale directory cleaned up)
