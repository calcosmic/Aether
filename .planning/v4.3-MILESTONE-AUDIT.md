# Milestone Audit: v4.3 Live Visibility & Auto-Learning

**Audited:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** PASSED
**Phases:** 2 (25-live-visibility, 26-auto-learning)
**Plans:** 4 total (3 + 1)

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| VIS-01: Workers write structured progress to activity.log | 25 | Satisfied | aether-utils.sh activity-log subcommand, all 6 worker specs |
| VIS-02: Queen spawns workers sequentially for incremental visibility | 25 | Satisfied | build.md Step 5c Queen execution loop |
| VIS-03: Queen displays activity log after each worker | 25 | Satisfied | build.md Step 5c activity-log-read + result summary |
| LEARN-01: build.md Step 7 extracts learnings to memory.json | 26 | Satisfied | Step 7a reads errors/events/outcomes, writes phase_learnings |
| LEARN-02: build.md Step 7 emits FEEDBACK pheromone | 26 | Satisfied | Step 7b validates via pheromone-validate, source "auto:build" |
| LEARN-03: continue.md skips duplicate extraction | 26 | Satisfied | Step 4 checks auto_learnings_extracted event by phase number |

**Score: 6/6 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Score | Status | Verified |

| 26. Auto-Learning | 7/7 must-haves | Passed | 2026-02-04 |

**Score: 2/2 phases verified (12/12 must-haves)**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| # | From | To | Via | Status |
|---|------|----|-----|--------|
| 1 | 25-01 activity-log subcommands | 25-02 worker specs (all 6) | bash calls in instructions | Wired |
| 2 | 25-02 worker specs | 25-03 build.md execution loop | workers call activity-log during execution | Wired |
| 3 | 25-01 activity-log-init | 25-03 build.md Step 5c | bash call at phase start | Wired |
| 4 | 25-01 activity-log-read | 25-03 build.md Step 5c | bash call after each worker | Wired |
| 5 | 25-03 Phase Lead plan output | 25-03 Step 5c Queen execution | in-memory data flow | Wired |
| 6 | 25-03 Step 5c worker_results | 26-01 Step 7a learning extraction | in-memory data flow | Wired |
| 7 | 26-01 Step 7a memory.json write | existing memory-compress | aether-utils.sh call | Wired |
| 8 | 26-01 Step 7b FEEDBACK pheromone | existing pheromone-validate | validation gate | Wired |
| 9 | 26-01 Step 7c pheromone-cleanup | existing pheromone-cleanup | aether-utils.sh call | Wired |
| 10 | 26-01 Step 7d events.json flag | 26-01 continue.md Step 4 | auto_learnings_extracted event type + phase content match | Wired |
| 11 | 25-03 Phase Lead planning-only constraint | -- | "MUST NOT use Task tool" enforcement | Enforced |
| 12 | 25-03 User plan checkpoint | -- | max 3 iterations before auto-proceed | Enforced |

**Score: 12/12 connections verified, 0 orphaned, 0 missing**

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Full build | /ant:build -> Phase Lead plans (5a) -> user confirms (5b) -> Queen spawns workers with activity log (5c) -> auto-learning extraction (7a-7e) | Complete |
| Build-then-continue | /ant:build completes -> /ant:continue -> detects auto_learnings_extracted -> skips Steps 4+4.5 -> proceeds to Step 5 | Complete |
| Activity log lifecycle | init (phase start) -> worker writes (during execution) -> Queen reads (after each worker) -> archive (next phase start) | Complete |

**Score: 3/3 flows complete**

## UAT Results

| Phase | Tests | Passed | Issues |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 25: Live Visibility | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| 26: Auto-Learning | 3 | 3 | 0 |

## Tech Debt

2 minor items, both non-blocking:

1. **continue.md Step 6** writes `learnings_extracted` event unconditionally even when Step 4 was skipped due to auto-extraction detection. Different event type from `auto_learnings_extracted` so does not affect duplicate detection. Cosmetic only.

2. **continue.md Step 8** display template shows "Learnings Extracted" section unconditionally but has no guidance for when Step 4 was skipped. LLM executor handles this contextually. Low severity.

## Human Verification Checklist

From phase VERIFICATION.md files — items requiring live testing:

### Phase 25
- [ ] Run `/ant:build` on a real phase — verify Phase Lead plans without spawning, Queen spawns sequentially, activity log displayed between workers
- [ ] Inspect `.aether/data/activity.log` after build — verify timestamps and caste-attributed entries
- [ ] Test plan checkpoint — respond with change request, verify re-planning (up to 3 iterations)

### Phase 26
- [ ] Run `/ant:build` then check memory.json — verify specific, caste-attributed learnings (not generic boilerplate)
- [ ] Run `/ant:build` then `/ant:continue` — verify skip message and jump to Step 5
- [ ] Run `/ant:continue force` after build — verify re-extraction despite auto flag
