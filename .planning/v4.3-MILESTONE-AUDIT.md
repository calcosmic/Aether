# Milestone Audit: v4.3 Live Visibility & Auto-Learning

**Audited:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** PASSED
**Phases:** 2 (25-live-visibility, 26-auto-learning)
**Plans:** 4 total (3 + 1)

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| VIS-01: Workers write structured progress to activity.log | 25 | ✓ Satisfied | aether-utils.sh activity-log subcommand, all 6 worker specs |
| VIS-02: Queen spawns workers sequentially for incremental visibility | 25 | ✓ Satisfied | build.md Step 5c Queen execution loop |
| VIS-03: Queen displays activity log after each worker | 25 | ✓ Satisfied | build.md Step 5c activity-log-read + result summary |
| LEARN-01: build.md Step 7 extracts learnings to memory.json | 26 | ✓ Satisfied | Step 7a reads errors/events/outcomes, writes phase_learnings |
| LEARN-02: build.md Step 7 emits FEEDBACK pheromone | 26 | ✓ Satisfied | Step 7b validates via pheromone-validate, source "auto:build" |
| LEARN-03: continue.md skips duplicate extraction | 26 | ✓ Satisfied | Step 4 checks auto_learnings_extracted event by phase number |

**Score: 6/6 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Score | Status | Verified |

**Score: 2/2 phases verified**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| Phase 25 Step 5c worker_results | Phase 26 Step 7a learning extraction | In-memory data flow | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 25 activity-log subcommands | Phase 25 build.md Step 5c | bash calls | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 25 activity-log subcommands | Phase 25 worker specs (all 6) | bash calls in instructions | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 25 Phase Lead planning | Phase 25 Queen execution | Task assignment plan → Step 5c | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 26 auto_learnings_extracted event | Phase 26 continue.md Step 4 | events.json flag check | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 26 memory.json write | Phase 26 memory-compress | aether-utils.sh call | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 26 pheromone-validate | Phase 26 FEEDBACK pheromone | validation gate | ✓ Wired |
| Phase 25 Step 6 spawn_outcomes | Phase 26 Step 7 guard | Explicit "do NOT update" note | ✓ Wired |

**Score: 8/8 connections verified, 0 orphaned**

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Full build | /ant:build → Phase Lead plans → user confirms → Queen spawns → activity log → learnings → pheromones → display | ✓ Complete |
| Build-then-continue | /ant:build completes → /ant:continue → detects auto-extraction → skips to Step 5 | ✓ Complete |
| Interrupted build | /ant:build fails → no flag event → /ant:continue extracts normally | ✓ Complete |

**Score: 3/3 flows complete**

## Tech Debt

2 minor items, both non-blocking:

1. **continue.md Step 6** writes `learnings_extracted` event unconditionally even when Step 4 was skipped due to auto-extraction detection. Different event type from `auto_learnings_extracted` so does not affect duplicate detection. Cosmetic only.

2. **continue.md Step 8** display template shows "Learnings Extracted" section unconditionally but has no guidance for when Step 4 was skipped. LLM executor handles this contextually. Low severity.

## Human Verification Checklist

From phase VERIFICATION.md files — items requiring live testing:

### Phase 25
- [ ] Run `/ant:build` on a real phase — verify Phase Lead plans without spawning, Queen spawns sequentially, activity log displayed between workers
- [ ] Inspect `.aether/data/activity.log` after build — verify timestamps and caste-attributed entries
- [ ] Test plan checkpoint — respond with change request, verify re-planning (up to 3 iterations)

### Phase 26
- [ ] Run `/ant:build` then check memory.json — verify specific, caste-attributed learnings (not generic boilerplate)
- [ ] Run `/ant:build` then `/ant:continue` — verify skip message and jump to Step 5
- [ ] Run `/ant:continue force` after build — verify re-extraction despite auto flag
