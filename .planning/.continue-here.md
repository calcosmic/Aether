<current_state>
v3.0 "Restore the Soul" milestone initialized. PROJECT.md committed. About to spawn 4 parallel researchers but user paused before they launched. No research files exist yet for v3. No REQUIREMENTS.md or ROADMAP.md for v3 yet.

Resume the CDS /cds:new-milestone flow at Phase 6 (Research).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Milestone validation - confirmed v2.0 complete, active roadmap acknowledged
- Deep questioning - extensive conversation about what v3 rebuild stripped vs what should come back
- Full audit of v2 deleted code - read every deleted command, worker spec, and utility from git history
- Identified exactly what was lost: visual identity, 6 commands, 4 specialist watchers, worker spec depth, infrastructure
- Architecture decisions made: JSON state files over bash, enrich existing commands over adding new, specialist modes inside watcher-ant.md
- Version determined: v3.0 major release
- PROJECT.md updated and committed (commit d87da67) with full v3.0 milestone scope
- config.json already exists from v2 (yolo mode, comprehensive depth, parallel execution)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

CDS new-milestone flow (Phase 6-9 remaining):

- Phase 6: Research - spawn 4 parallel cds-project-researcher agents + synthesizer
  - Stack: CLI visual patterns, JSON state management for agent systems
  - Features: what sophisticated multi-agent systems need (error tracking, memory, event awareness)
  - Architecture: how to integrate infrastructure into Claude Code skill prompt commands
  - Pitfalls: common mistakes when enriching agent systems with state/memory/tracking
  - Then spawn cds-research-synthesizer for SUMMARY.md
- Phase 7: Define Requirements - scope features by category, create REQUIREMENTS.md with REQ-IDs
- Phase 8: Create Roadmap - spawn cds-roadmapper, phases start at 14 (phases 3-13 used by v1+v2)
- Phase 9: Done - present completion, route to /cds:plan-phase 14
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **v3.0 major version** - significant restoration, not a patch
- **No new commands** - enrich existing 12 commands rather than adding back deleted ones
  - /ant:errors -> fold into /ant:status
  - /ant:review -> fold into /ant:continue
  - /ant:memory -> fold into /ant:status
  - /ant:adjust -> use existing focus/redirect/feedback
  - /ant:recover -> fold into /ant:resume-colony
- **Specialist watcher modes** - security/performance/quality/test-coverage as modes inside watcher-ant.md, not 4 separate spec files
- **JSON state for infrastructure** - errors.json, memory.json, events.json manipulated via Read/Write tools (no bash scripts)
- **Worker specs ~200 lines** - restore pheromone math, combination effects, feedback interpretation (up from 90, down from 621)
- **Phase Lead emergence model kept** - v3 rebuild's best innovation stays
- **Read/Write tool execution model kept** - v3 rebuild's core architecture improvement stays
- **Research opted in** - user wants domain research before requirements
- **User gave full license** to make architectural decisions about what comes back and in what form

<dead_ends>

| Approach | Why It Won't Work | Don't Retry Because |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Bash/jq in commands | Fragile, error-prone, schema mismatches | v3 rebuild proved Read/Write tools more reliable |
| 19 separate commands | Too many thin commands | v3's 12 richer commands is better UX |
| 4 separate watcher spec files | Rigid, can't adapt | Modes inside watcher-ant.md is more emergent |
| 879-line bash event bus | Overly complex for prompt-based agents | Simple JSON event log achieves same goal |
| Bash memory scripts | Complex, fragile | JSON state files with Read/Write tools simpler |
| Ralph's audit fixes | Audit was against v2 bash code | v3 commands don't use bash, issues don't apply |

<context>
The user built an incredibly sophisticated ant colony system over v1+v2 (383k words of research, 19 commands, 10 worker ants, 26 utility scripts). Then a v3 "rebuild" correctly fixed the command execution model (Read/Write tools instead of bash/jq) but went too far - stripping out visual polish, specialist watchers, worker spec depth, and all infrastructure. The system works but feels hollow.

v3.0 "Restore the Soul" brings back everything that made the system feel alive, rebuilt natively for Claude Code skill prompts. The key insight: the v3 rebuild confused "simplify how commands run" with "simplify what the system does."

The user wants this to be the most sophisticated self-spawning agent system that exists. They gave full license to make architectural decisions.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: The existing .planning/ROADMAP.md and .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md are from v2.0 (phases 11-13, all complete). They need to be REPLACED with v3.0 content during this milestone flow. The existing research/ directory has v2 research - it will be overwritten with v3 research.

Key files to understand the current system:
- .aether/HANDOFF.md - documents the v3 rebuild (all 7 phases of it)
- .claude/commands/ant/*.md - the 12 current commands
- .aether/workers/*.md - the 6 current worker specs (~90 lines each)
- .aether/data/*.json - the 3 current state files
- .planning/PROJECT.md - just updated with v3.0 milestone scope

To see what v2 had (now deleted): use git show HEAD~1:<filepath> for any deleted file.

Resume the CDS /cds:new-milestone flow at Phase 6 (Research):

1. Spawn 4 parallel cds-project-researcher agents for v3 domain research
2. Spawn cds-research-synthesizer for SUMMARY.md
3. Continue to Phase 7 (Requirements), Phase 8 (Roadmap), Phase 9 (Done)

Command: /cds:resume-work
