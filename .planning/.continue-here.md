<current_state>
Mid-way through /cds:new-milestone. Phase 1 (validate) and Phase 2 (present context) complete. Phase 3 (questioning) started — postmortem analyzed, 7 fixes presented, user wants to discuss all fixes before confirming scope.

The postmortem from the M4L-AnalogWave-System deployment is the driving input. It documents a real-world failure where the Ant Colony system produced good work but the framework overhead nearly crushed the value.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Read and analyzed postmortem: `/Users/callumcowie/Documents/Max 9/M4L-AnalogWave-System/.aether/COLONY_POSTMORTEM.md`
- Explored full Aether codebase via 3 parallel agents (commands, state files, utils, worker specs)
- Confirmed postmortem line counts match actual codebase (~6,393 total lines)
- Validated no active milestone (ROADMAP.md doesn't exist)
- Presented previous milestone context (v5.0 NPM Distribution shipped)
- Presented 7-fix scope summary to user
- User acknowledged scope but explicitly said "we need to discuss all of this"
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Questioning (RESUME HERE)
- Walk through each of the 7 postmortem fixes with user
- Discuss trade-offs, confirm what's in/out of scope
- User wants real discussion, not rubber-stamping

## After Questioning Completes
- Version selection (likely v6.0 major — this is architectural)
- Update PROJECT.md with new milestone goals → commit
- Research decision (likely skip — postmortem IS the research)
- Define REQUIREMENTS.md from confirmed fixes → commit
- Spawn cds-roadmapper → create ROADMAP.md → commit
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Using /cds:new-milestone workflow (user explicitly chose this over ad-hoc plan mode)
- Postmortem serves as primary analysis — no need to re-diagnose
</decisions_made>

<attempted_approaches>

- **Started with EnterPlanMode:** User redirected to /cds:new-milestone mid-planning.
  - **Result**: Plan mode entered, explore agents ran, but user wanted CDS workflow
  - **Learning**: User prefers structured CDS workflow for this project
</attempted_approaches>

<dead_ends>

| Approach | Why It Won't Work | Don't Retry Because |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Ad-hoc plan mode | User explicitly chose /cds:new-milestone | Project uses CDS workflow consistently |

## The Postmortem — 7 Fixes in Priority Order

Source: `/Users/callumcowie/Documents/Max 9/M4L-AnalogWave-System/.aether/COLONY_POSTMORTEM.md`

### CRITICAL
1. **Consolidate 6 state files → 1** — Single COLONY_STATE.json absorbs PROJECT_PLAN, pheromones, errors, memory, events. One read, one write per command. Eliminates cross-file consistency bugs.
2. **Move state updates to command start** — Write immediately after each task completes, not batched at end where context runs out and writes get dropped.

### HIGH
3. **Replace pheromone math with simple TTL** — `expires_at` timestamp + priority (high/normal/low) replaces exponential decay + 144-value sensitivity matrices + half-life math.
4. **Collapse 6 worker specs → 1 file** — 1,866 lines → ~200 lines. Keep role descriptions, remove repeated boilerplate (pheromone math, event awareness, activity log, validation, spawn rules).
5. **Shrink command files 60-70%** — Remove verbose display templates, redundant validation, Bayesian spawn tracking. 3,820 lines → ~1,110 target.

### MEDIUM
6. **Remove most of aether-utils.sh** — Keep validate-state and error-add. Inline or remove pheromone math (5 commands), memory-compress, spawn-check.
7. **Output-as-state for builds** — Deliverable files (.planning/phase-N/*.md) become primary record. State file tracks only: current phase, colony goal, active signals.

### Target Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| State files per command | 6 read, 3-6 write | 1 read, 1 write |
| Command file avg lines | 340 | 100 |
| Worker spec total lines | 1,866 | 200 |
| Total system lines | ~7,400 | ~1,800 |
| Framework overhead | ~70% | ~20% |

### What to PRESERVE
1. Parallel task decomposition (Wave 1 independent → Wave 2 synthesis)
2. Structured phase output (.planning/phase-N/ directories)
3. Worker role concept (match agent type to task type)
4. Signal/constraint concept (just simplify implementation)
5. Quality gates (watcher review before phase advancement)
6. Pause/resume capability
7. Phase-based planning

</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/cds:resume-work`.

Pick up questioning — walk through the 7 fixes with the user to confirm scope. Start by asking which fixes they want to discuss first, or go in priority order (critical → high → medium).

After scope is confirmed: version selection → PROJECT.md → requirements → roadmap.
