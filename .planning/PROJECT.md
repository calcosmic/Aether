# Aether

## What This Is

Aether is a biomimetic AI colony framework: a Go runtime in `cmd/` and `pkg/` that owns state, worker dispatch, verification, memory, and install/update flows, plus companion command surfaces for Claude Code and OpenCode and a runtime-native Codex CLI lane.

`v1.0` restored the lost colony ceremony and runtime visibility surfaces.

`v1.1` made Aether's context layer trustworthy, inspectable, deterministic, and benchmarkable.

`v1.8` added the colony recovery system: `aether recover` detects 7 stuck-state classes, auto-fixes safe issues, prompts for destructive ones, and proves correctness through 10 E2E tests.

`v1.9` added the review persistence system: 7-domain review ledgers accumulate findings across phases, agents persist findings via CLI, colony-prime injects prior reviews into worker context, and full lifecycle integration (seal/entomb/status/init).

`v1.10` completed the colony polish: smart review depth (light/heavy), gate failure recovery with skip logic, Porter ant (26th caste), full lifecycle ceremony (seal, init, status, entomb, resume, discuss, chaos, oracle, patrol), Oracle loop fix with research formulation, idea shelving system, QUEEN.md pipeline fix, and Hive Brain wiring into seal.

`v1.11` unified Aether: removed self-hosting artifacts (stale agents, duplicate commands, orphaned companion files), restored lost Smart Init intelligence (charter ceremony, rich init-research, suggest-analyze), hardened the 3-platform experience, and improved user-facing flows.

## Core Value

**Aether should feel alive and truthful at runtime, not only look clever in wrappers or tests.**

That means:

- worker lifecycle must be inspectable and honest
- dispatch visibility must come from real runtime state
- stale run state must not poison future commands
- verification must lead advancement decisions
- partial success and recovery must be first-class
- stuck colonies must be recoverable with a single command
- review findings must survive `/clear` and accumulate across phases

## Current State

- Go runtime is healthy, v1.0.24 shipped
- Milestone v1.11 Aether Unification complete (shipped 2026-04-30)
- 2900+ tests passing, full E2E regression coverage
- Stable and dev publish channels with integrity verification
- Colony recovery system: `aether recover` + `--apply` for stuck-state rescue
- Review persistence system: 7-domain ledger CRUD, colony-prime injection, lifecycle integration
- Idea shelving: persistent colony backlog, auto-shelve at seal, surface at init, survive entomb

## Architecture / Key Patterns

- **Go runtime is authoritative** for state mutations, verification, and CLI truth
- **Wrappers are presentation-only** on Claude/OpenCode
- **Codex is runtime-native**; no markdown wrapper ceremony
- **YAML remains source-of-truth** for generated wrapper commands
- **Runtime proof beats wrapper theater**
- **Shared lifecycle truth matters**; `build`, `plan`, `colonize`, `watch`, `status`, and `continue` should agree on what a worker is doing
- **Recovery is first-class**; stuck colonies get a rescue button, not manual file surgery
- **Review persistence is first-class**; findings accumulate across phases and survive session resets

### Active

- Full loop audit across all Aether commands (continue, build, plan, seal, etc.) -- v1.12

### Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cross-colony ledger sharing | Findings contain code-specific file paths and line numbers that go stale across repos |
| Auto-block on critical findings | Would create conflicting signals with existing continue-review blocking |
| Auto finding-to-pheromone promotion | Mapping between "finding" and "action" requires judgment, not automation |
| Real-time ledger sync across agents | YAGNI -- agents write during build/continue, not concurrently |
| Ledger web UI | CLI-only for now; web dashboard is a future consideration |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Outcome | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Review findings are colony-scoped (not cross-colony) | Code-specific paths go stale across repos | Good |
| Domain ledger uses append pattern with computed summaries | No separate phase snapshots needed (YAGNI) | Good |
| All new struct fields use `omitempty` | Backward compatibility with old JSON | Good |
| Zero new dependencies | Uses existing pkg/storage/, cobra, Go stdlib | Good |
| Tracker gets bugs domain carve-out | Write for findings only, never for applying fixes | Good |
| Colony-prime reads from cached summary | Performance over 7 direct ledger reads | Good |

## Context

Shipped v1.10 with 452 files changed, +53,409 / -562 lines across 204 commits.
Tech stack: Go 1.24, Cobra CLI, pkg/storage file locking.
34 plans across 14 phases (57-69). All verified.

## Explicit Deferrals

These remain promising but are not the next best move:

- pheromone markets and reputation exchange
- swarm memory beyond the current hive/wisdom path
- federation / inter-colony coordination
- self-mutating agents / evolution engine

## Next Move

Execute v1.11 with `/gsd-discuss-phase 70`.

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

## Current Milestone: v1.11 Aether Unification

**Goal:** Make Aether clean, canonical, and intelligent again — remove self-hosting artifacts, restore lost Smart Init intelligence, harden the 3-platform experience, and improve user-facing flows.

**Target features:**
- Self-hosting cleanup — audit and remove all artifacts that exist because Aether was used to develop itself
- Smart Init ceremony — re-port charter approval flow, repo scanning, governance detection to Go
- Rich init-research — port deep codebase analysis (colony context, governance, pheromone suggestions, complexity)
- Suggest-analyze — restore automatic pheromone suggestions during builds
- Platform hardening — fix OpenCode parity gaps, harden error handling, cross-platform consistency
- User experience — better onboarding, clearer feedback, smoother flows

**Known losses from shell-to-Go migration (April 2026):**
- Colony charter ceremony (scan.sh → charter-write → approval flow)
- Rich init-research (tech stack, directory analysis, colony context, governance detection, 10 pheromone patterns)
- Suggest-analyze (618 lines of automatic pattern detection)
- Bayesian confidence scoring (40/35/25 weighted, 60-day half-life decay, 7 trust tiers)
- Circuit breaker (cascade failure protection)
- State machine transitions (explicit validation, pheromone-triggered, checkpoints)
- Council system (deliberation framework)
- Curation ant pipeline (8-ant orchestrated pipeline)
- Consolidation pipeline (phase-end knowledge compression)

## Current Milestone: v1.12 Safe Colony

**Goal:** Make Aether loop-proof and give users independent control over planning depth and verification depth, with smart defaults that adapt to phase position and code change risk.

**Target features:**
- Full loop audit — scan every Aether command for potential infinite loops, add circuit breakers
- Independent depth controls — separate planning depth from verification depth, both user-settable
- Smart depth defaults — auto-select depth from phase position + code change risk signals
- User depth override — tick-a-box UI at `/ant-plan` start to override either depth before plan creation

*Last updated: 2026-04-30 — v1.12 Safe Colony milestone started*
