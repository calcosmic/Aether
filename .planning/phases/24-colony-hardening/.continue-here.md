<current_state>
All 5 handoff issues from the Pygame raycaster test session are implemented, multi-agent validated, committed, and pushed. This phase is COMPLETE. The handoff doc (.aether/HANDOFF.md) describes the original problems; all are resolved.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Issue 1: Per-caste pheromone computation - Done (build.md Step 3 + status.md)
- Issue 2: Watcher execution verification - Done (watcher-ant.md + build.md Step 5.5)
- Issue 3: Build output & delegation log - Done (build.md Step 7)
- Issue 4: Worker progress output - Done (all 6 worker specs)
- Issue 5: Learning extraction flow - Done (build.md Step 7, /ant:continue is now primary action)
- Previously done (prior session): Phase Lead delegation protocol (build.md Step 5)
- Previously done (prior session): Visual identity & emoji (c7500d5)
- Previously done (prior session): Legacy code cleanup ~27k lines (a3bfd8b)

Commits:
- c7500d5: Visual identity & emoji
- a3bfd8b: Legacy code cleanup
- bca82a1: Watcher execution, delegation protocol, progress output, build output improvements
- 9fe973e: Gitignore backups, commit untracked planning/audit docs
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
None for this phase. All 5 issues are resolved.

Potential next work (from the test session observations, not yet planned):
- Run another end-to-end test of the colony system to validate these fixes work in practice
- The test session used a Pygame raycaster; a different project type would broaden validation
- Consider a v5.0 milestone if new issues emerge from testing
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Watcher "Checking" vs "Created/Modified" in progress output: Initially used role-appropriate "Checking" for watcher since it rarely creates files. Multi-agent review flagged inconsistency. Changed to standard "Created/Modified" format for cross-caste consistency.
- Learning extraction (Issue 5): Chose Option A (prompt user to run /ant:continue) over Option B (auto-extract in build). Simpler, preserves user agency, avoids making build.md longer.
- Per-caste pheromone display in status.md: Shows only castes that would PRIORITIZE (>0.5) to keep output compact rather than showing all 6 castes for every signal.
- Committed all changes as one feat commit rather than per-issue, since the changes are interdependent (e.g., progress output enables delegation log which enables Step 7 display).
</decisions_made>

<attempted_approaches>
None failed. All changes were text/markdown edits to spec files with clear requirements from the handoff document. Implementation was straightforward.

| N/A | No dead ends encountered | All 5 issues had clear specs in HANDOFF.md |

<context>
This work originated from a real-world test: the colony system built a Pygame raycaster game ("Depths of Aether") across 5 phases. The game worked (avg 8.8/10 watcher scores) but the colony metaphor scored 3/10 — ants didn't delegate, watchers rubber-stamped without running code, no progress was visible, and learnings were lost. These 5 fixes address each failure mode. The system hasn't been re-tested yet with these fixes in place.

The CDS planning system (v4.1) is at milestone completion. STATE.md shows 74 plans across 5 milestones. This colony-hardening work was done outside CDS since it was driven by a test session report rather than a planned milestone.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: Run another end-to-end colony test (e.g., /ant:init with a new project) to validate that delegation, execution verification, progress output, and learning extraction actually work in practice. If issues emerge, plan a v5.0 milestone.
</next_action>
