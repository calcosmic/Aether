Phase 2: Worker Ant Castes - COMPLETED
Session paused after completing all 9 tasks.

Ready to begin Phase 3: Pheromone Communication.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Phase 1 & 2 Complete:**

Phase 1: Colony Foundation (8/8 tasks)
- Created all state schemas (COLONY_STATE, pheromones, worker_ants, memory)
- Implemented file locking mechanism (.aether/utils/file-lock.sh)
- Implemented atomic write pattern (.aether/utils/atomic-write.sh)
- Updated /ant:init and /ant:status commands

Phase 2: Worker Ant Castes (9/9 tasks)
- Created 6 Worker Ant caste prompts:
  - Colonizer Ant (codebase colonization, semantic indexing)
  - Route-setter Ant (phase planning, task breakdown)
  - Builder Ant (code implementation, commands)
  - Watcher Ant (validation, testing, quality)
  - Scout Ant (research, documentation)
  - Architect Ant (memory compression, patterns)
- Implemented Task tool spawning pattern in all caste prompts
- Updated /ant:phase command
- Created /ant:build command (named as requested)

**Key Files Created/Modified:**
- .aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json - Main colony state
- .aether/data/pheromones.json - Pheromone signals (schema ready)
- .aether/data/worker_ants.json - Worker Ant castes (new names)
- .aether/data/memory.json - Triple-layer memory
- .aether/workers/colonizer-ant.md
- .aether/workers/route-setter-ant.md
- .aether/workers/builder-ant.md
- .aether/workers/watcher-ant.md
- .aether/workers/scout-ant.md
- .aether/workers/architect-ant.md
- .claude/commands/ant/init.md - Updated for Aether v2
- .claude/commands/ant/status.md - Updated with new caste names
- .claude/commands/ant/phase.md - Updated
- .claude/commands/ant/build.md - Created (renamed from execute)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Phase 3: Pheromone Communication** (8 tasks, 0 complete)

Tasks from ROADMAP.md:
- 03-01: Implement pheromone signal schema in pheromones.json (type, strength, created_at, decay_rate)
- 03-02: Implement decay calculation for each pheromone type (INIT: none, FOCUS: 1h, REDIRECT: 24h, FEEDBACK: 6h)
- 03-03: Create /ant:focus command prompt (Queen emits attract pheromone, guides colony attention)
- 03-04: Create /ant:redirect command prompt (Queen emits repel pheromone, warns colony away)
- 03-05: Create /ant:feedback command prompt (Queen emits guidance pheromone, shapes colony behavior)
- 03-06: Implement caste sensitivity profiles in worker_ants.json (already in schema)
- 03-07: Implement effective strength calculation (pheromone strength × caste sensitivity)
- 03-08: Implement pheromone combination response logic (ants respond to signal blends)

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Caste Naming**: Using new descriptive names (colonizer, route_setter, builder, watcher, scout, architect) throughout
- **Command Naming**: User requested "build" instead of "execute" for phase execution
- **Pheromone Schema**: Already created in pheromones.json with half-life definitions
- **Sensitivity Profiles**: Already defined in pheromones.json for all castes

</decisions_made>

<attempted_approaches>

No failed approaches in this session. All implementations proceeded smoothly.

</attempted_approaches>

<dead_ends>

No dead ends encountered.

</dead_ends>

<blockers>

No blockers. Ready to proceed with Phase 3.

<context>

**Aether v2 Status:**
- Phases 1 & 2 complete (17/100 tasks)
- 10-phase roadmap for building colony infrastructure
- Fixed roadmap - not creating custom phases, building predefined colony system

**Current State:**
- Colony foundation infrastructure in place
- All Worker Ant caste prompts created with autonomous spawning
- Ready to implement pheromone communication system

**Aether Philosophy:**
- Emergence Over Orchestration - Worker Ants spawn Worker Ants autonomously
- Structure at boundaries, emergence within - Phase checkpoints, pure emergence during execution
- Stigmergy - Pheromone signals as communication medium (environment holds state)

**Next Phase Focus:**
Phase 3 implements the pheromone communication layer - the stigmergic signaling system that enables colony coordination without central control.

</context>

<next_action>

**To continue Phase 3 after clearing context:**

```
/cds:resume-work
```

This will:
1. Load STATE.md and detect current position (Phase 2 complete, Phase 3 ready)
2. Present status and offer to begin Phase 3
3. Start with task 03-01: Implement pheromone signal decay calculations

**Phase 3 first action when resuming:**
Implement pheromone signal decay calculations in the pheromone system. The schema exists in pheromones.json but needs the actual decay calculation logic.

</next_action>
