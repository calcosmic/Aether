Phase 3: Pheromone Communication - READY TO BEGIN
Planning complete. Ready to execute 6 plans in 3 waves.
</current_state>

<phase_plan>
**Phase 3: Pheromone Communication**

Goal: Colony coordinates through stigmergic pheromone signals with time-based decay and caste-specific sensitivity

Plans: 6 plans in 3 waves

Wave 1 (Parallel - 3 plans):
- 03-01: Create /ant:focus command (FOCUS pheromone, 1-hour decay)
- 03-02: Create /ant:redirect command (REDIRECT pheromone, 24-hour decay)
- 03-03: Create /ant:feedback command (FEEDBACK pheromone, 6-hour decay)

Wave 2 (Parallel - 2 plans, depends on Wave 1):
- 03-04: Update Colonizer, Route-setter, Builder Ant prompts (pheromone reading)
- 03-05: Update Watcher, Scout, Architect Ant prompts (pheromone reading)

Wave 3 (Sequential - 1 plan, depends on Wave 2):
- 03-06: Verification and human checkpoint

Key Implementation Notes:
- Schema already complete in pheromones.json (tasks 03-01, 03-02, 03-06 done)
- Commands use bash/jq pattern from init.md (not Python)
- Decay is interpreted by Worker Ants on-read (not calculated by code)
- Effective strength = signal strength × caste sensitivity
</phase_plan>

<decisions_made>

- **Prompt-Based System**: Decay and effective strength are interpreted by Worker Ants, not calculated by code
- **init.md Pattern**: All pheromone commands follow the exact pattern from init.md (jq + atomic-write)
- **Schema Reuse**: pheromones.json already has complete schema with decay rates and caste sensitivities
- **Caste Sensitivities**: worker_ants.json already has sensitivity_profile for each caste
- **No Python**: Commands are pure bash/jq implementation

</decisions_made>

<context>

**Aether v2 Status:**
- Phases 1 & 2 complete (17/100 tasks)
- Phase 3 planned and ready to execute
- 10-phase roadmap for building colony infrastructure

**Current State:**
- Colony foundation infrastructure complete
- All Worker Ant caste prompts created with autonomous spawning
- Pheromone schema complete (decay rates, sensitivities defined)
- Ready to implement pheromone communication commands and Worker Ant responses

**Aether Philosophy:**
- Stigmergy - Pheromone signals as communication medium
- Environment holds state (pheromones.json)
- Worker Ants interpret signals locally based on caste sensitivity
- Queen provides intention, colony self-organizes

**Phase 3 Focus:**
Implement the pheromone communication layer - the stigmergic signaling system that enables colony coordination without central control.

<next_action>

**To begin Phase 3 execution:**

```
/cds:execute-phase 03
```

This will:
1. Execute Wave 1 plans in parallel (focus, redirect, feedback commands)
2. Execute Wave 2 plans in parallel (Worker Ant prompt updates)
3. Execute Wave 3 verification plan
4. Create SUMMARY files for each completed plan
5. Present completion status and next steps

**Phase 3 first action:**
Execute plan 03-01 to create the /ant:focus command following the init.md pattern.
