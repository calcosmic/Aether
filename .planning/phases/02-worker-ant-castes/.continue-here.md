Phase 2: Worker Ant Castes - COMPLETED

All 9 tasks have been completed successfully. All six Worker Ant caste prompts are created with autonomous spawning capability.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Phase 2 Tasks Completed:**

✅ **02-01: Colonizer Ant Prompt**
- Created Colonizer Ant prompt file (.aether/workers/colonizer-ant.md)
- Capabilities: codebase analysis, semantic indexing, pattern detection, dependency mapping
- Spawning: framework specialists, architecture scouts, security scouts

✅ **02-02: Route-setter Ant Prompt**
- Created Route-setter Ant prompt file (.aether/workers/route-setter-ant.md)
- Capabilities: phase planning, task breakdown, dependency analysis, resource allocation
- Spawning: estimators, risk assessors, dependency analyzers

✅ **02-03: Builder Ant Prompt**
- Created Builder Ant prompt file (.aether/workers/builder-ant.md)
- Capabilities: code implementation, command execution, file manipulation, testing setup
- Spawning: framework specialists, database specialists, security specialists

✅ **02-04: Watcher Ant Prompt**
- Created Watcher Ant prompt file (.aether/workers/watcher-ant.md)
- Capabilities: validation, testing, quality checks, security review, performance analysis
- Spawning: parallel specialist perspectives (security, performance, quality, test coverage)

✅ **02-05: Scout Ant Prompt**
- Created Scout Ant prompt file (.aether/workers/scout-ant.md)
- Capabilities: information gathering, documentation search, context retrieval, external research
- Spawning: framework scouts, API explorers, documentation readers

✅ **02-06: Architect Ant Prompt**
- Created Architect Ant prompt file (.aether/workers/architect-ant.md)
- Capabilities: memory compression, pattern extraction, knowledge synthesis, associative linking
- Spawning: analysis architects, compression architects, knowledge architects

✅ **02-07: Task Tool Spawning Pattern**
- Implemented in all Worker Ant prompts
- Includes: capability gap detection, specialist type mapping, context inheritance
- Resource constraints: max 10 spawns/phase, max depth 3, circuit breaker after 3 failures

✅ **02-08: /ant:phase Command**
- Updated command file (.claude/commands/ant/phase.md)
- Shows phase details, tasks, caste assignments, requirements mapping
- Supports: /ant:phase (current), /ant:phase N (specific), /ant:phase list (all)

✅ **02-09: /ant:build Command**
- Created command file (.claude/commands/ant/build.md) - named "build" as requested
- Triggers phase execution with pure emergence
- Spawns phase coordinator, manages autonomous execution

**Worker Ant Caste Files Created:**
- .aether/workers/colonizer-ant.md
- .aether/workers/route-setter-ant.md
- .aether/workers/builder-ant.md
- .aether/workers/watcher-ant.md
- .aether/workers/scout-ant.md
- .aether/workers/architect-ant.md

**Commands Updated/Created:**
- .claude/commands/ant/phase.md - Updated
- .claude/commands/ant/build.md - Created (renamed from "execute")

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Phase 2 is COMPLETE.**

Next: Phase 3 - Pheromone Communication
- Implement pheromone signal decay calculations
- Create /ant:focus command (emit focus pheromone)
- Create /ant:redirect command (emit redirect pheromone)
- Create /ant:feedback command (emit feedback pheromone)
- Implement caste sensitivity profiles in state
- Implement effective strength calculations
- Implement pheromone combination response logic

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Command Naming**: User requested "build" instead of "execute" for the phase execution command
- **Caste Names**: Using new descriptive names throughout (colonizer, route_setter, builder, watcher, scout, architect)
- **Spawning Pattern**: Embedded in all Worker Ant prompts with context inheritance
- **Parallel Spawning**: Watcher Ant spawns multiple parallel perspectives for comprehensive validation

</decisions_made>

<context>

**Aether v2 Philosophy:**
- Emergence Over Orchestration - Worker Ants spawn Worker Ants autonomously
- Structure at boundaries, emergence within - Phase checkpoints, pure emergence during execution
- Stigmergy - Pheromone signals as communication medium

**Worker Ant Castes (Complete):**
All six castes now have complete prompt files with:
- Purpose and capabilities
- Sensitivity profiles for each pheromone type
- Autonomous spawning decision flows
- Context inheritance structure
- Quality standards

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Phase 3: Pheromone Communication
- Implement pheromone signal decay
- Create pheromone emission commands (focus, redirect, feedback)
- Implement caste-specific responses

**Key files for next phase:**
- .planning/ROADMAP.md - Phase 3 tasks
- .aether/data/pheromones.json - Pheromone signal schema
- .aether/workers/*.md - Worker Ant sensitivity profiles

</context>

<next_action>

**Phase 2 Complete!**

The Worker Ant caste system is now in place:
- ✅ 6 Worker Ant caste prompts created
- ✅ Autonomous spawning pattern implemented
- ✅ /ant:phase command updated
- ✅ /ant:build command created

**Ready for Phase 3: Pheromone Communication**

To continue:
1. Review Phase 3 tasks in ROADMAP.md
2. Implement pheromone signal decay calculations
3. Create /ant:focus, /ant:redirect, /ant:feedback commands
4. Implement caste sensitivity response logic

**Command to continue:** /cds:resume-work
