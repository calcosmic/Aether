<objective>
Create comprehensive manual E2E test guide documenting all core Aether colony workflows with step-by-step instructions, expected outputs, and verification checks.

Purpose: Manual testing is essential for LLM-based systems due to non-deterministic behavior. Automated tests catch component bugs, but manual tests catch reasoning issues and validate that the colony behaves intelligently in real scenarios.
Output: E2E-TEST-GUIDE.md with 6 workflow sections, each containing 3 test scenarios (happy path, failure case, edge case), with traceable verification IDs (VERIF-01 through VERIF-60+).

  <name>Create E2E test guide structure with introduction and setup sections</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-e2e-testing/E2E-TEST-GUIDE.md</files>
  <action>
Create E2E-TEST-GUIDE.md with the following structure:

1. **Introduction Section:**
   - Purpose of manual E2E testing for LLM-based systems
   - How to use this guide (step-by-step execution)
   - Verification ID explanation (VERIF-XX format for traceability)
   - What makes E2E testing different from automated tests

2. **Test Environment Setup Section:**
   - Prerequisites (git repo, bash, jq, Aether commands available)
   - Colony state backup/restore procedures (using cp commands for state files)
   - Clean slate initialization steps
   - Test isolation best practices

3. **Workflow Section Template (to be used for all 6 workflows):**
   For each workflow (Init, Execute, Spawning, Memory, Voting, Event):
   - Overview: What this workflow does and why it matters
   - Prerequisites: Required colony state before testing
   - Test 1.X: Happy Path (success case)
   - Test 1.X+1: Failure Case (error handling)
   - Test 1.X+2: Edge Case (boundary conditions)

4. **Appendix A: Verification ID Mapping:**
   - Table mapping VERIF-XX IDs to requirements (TEST-01 through TEST-06)
   - Ensures full requirement traceability

Use markdown format with:
- H1 for main sections (#)
- H2 for workflows (##)
- H3 for test cases (###)
- H4 for subsections (####)
- Code blocks with bash for commands and expected outputs
- Bullet points for verification checks

**Important:** This task only creates the structure with placeholder workflow sections. Do NOT write actual test cases yet - that comes in the next task.

Reference RESEARCH.md patterns:
- Test case template from "Code Examples > Test Case Template"
- Verification check examples from "Code Examples > Verification Check Examples"
- State backup/restore pattern from "Code Examples > State Backup/Restore Pattern"

  <files>.planning/phases/13-e2e-testing/E2E-TEST-GUIDE.md</files>
  <action>
Write comprehensive test cases for the first 3 workflows (Init, Execute, Spawning).

For each workflow, write 3 test cases (happy path, failure case, edge case):

**Workflow 1: Init (Colony Initialization)**
- Test 1.1: Happy Path - Successful colony initialization with valid goal
  - Steps: Run /ant:init with valid goal
  - Expected output: Full initialization output with step progress, colony mobilized message, Worker Ants listed with emoji status indicators
  - Verification checks (VERIF-01 through VERIF-08): State file exists, goal stored, colony status INIT, phase 1, all workers ready, INIT pheromone active, session ID generated, working memory contains intention
  - State verification: Before (no state file), After (verify all fields)

- Test 1.2: Failure Case - Re-initialization attempt
  - Steps: Run /ant:init twice without resetting
  - Expected output: Error message "Colony already initialized"
  - Verification checks (VERIF-09 through VERIF-11): Second init fails, original goal preserved, state unchanged

- Test 1.3: Edge Case - Empty or invalid goal input
  - Steps: Run /ant:init with empty string or very long goal
  - Expected output: Graceful handling or validation error
  - Verification checks (VERIF-12 through VERIF-14): Input validation works, colony not partially initialized, clear error message

**Workflow 2: Execute (Phase Execution)**
- Test 2.1: Happy Path - Successful phase execution with autonomous spawning
  - Steps: Initialize colony, run /ant:execute 1, observe execution
  - Expected output: Step progress (6 steps), Worker Ant mobilization, autonomous spawning messages (Task tool invocations), phase completion
  - Verification checks (VERIF-15 through VERIF-22): Phase status changes to in_progress then completed, autonomous spawning occurs (Task tool used), Worker Ant activity indicators update, pheromones emitted, events published
  - State verification: Before (phase ready), After (phase completed, spawn tracking populated)

- Test 2.2: Failure Case - Phase execution with blocked tasks
  - Steps: Create scenario where tasks cannot complete (missing dependencies), run /ant:execute
  - Expected output: Error handling, phase status shows blocked/incomplete
  - Verification checks (VERIF-23 through VERIF-26): Errors logged, phase not marked complete, spawn budget not exhausted, colony recovers

- Test 2.3: Edge Case - Re-execute completed phase
  - Steps: Run /ant:execute on already completed phase
  - Expected output: Message "Phase X is already complete"
  - Verification checks (VERIF-27 through VERIF-29): Execution rejected, phase status unchanged, no duplicate spawns

**Workflow 3: Spawning (Autonomous Worker Spawning)**
- Test 3.1: Happy Path - Successful specialist spawn with Bayesian confidence update
  - Steps: Trigger scenario requiring specialist (e.g., database task), observe autonomous spawn
  - Expected output: Colonizer detects capability gap, uses Task tool to spawn database_specialist, spawn recorded in tracking
  - Verification checks (VERIF-30 through VERIF-37): Capability gap detected, specialist spawned (not duplicate), spawn_tracking.record_spawn() called, Bayesian confidence updated (alpha/beta params), circuit breaker not triggered, spawn depth within limit, spawn budget available, meta-learning data populated
  - State verification: Before (confidence baseline), After (confidence increased for successful spawn)

- Test 3.2: Failure Case - Circuit breaker activation after repeated failures
  - Steps: Force 3+ spawn failures for same specialist, attempt another spawn
  - Expected output: Circuit breaker blocks spawn, error message logged
  - Verification checks (VERIF-38 through VERIF-42): Circuit breaker status open, spawn rejected, failure_count >= 3, circuit_breaker.last_triggered timestamp set, spawn_tracking.spawn_blocked() returns true

- Test 3.3: Edge Case - Max spawn depth reached
  - Steps: Create spawn chain at max depth (5 levels), attempt another spawn
  - Expected output: Spawn rejected due to depth limit
  - Verification checks (VERIF-43 through VERIF-46): spawn_depth == 5, spawn rejected, depth_limit_enforced error logged, no infinite spawn loop

Use the test case template from RESEARCH.md for each test:
- Overview (brief description)
- Prerequisites (colony state, files needed)
- Test Steps (numbered 1, 2, 3... with bash commands)
- Expected Outputs (code blocks with terminal output including emojis and progress indicators)
- Verification Checks (bullet points with VERIF-XX IDs, specific jq commands or checks)
- State Verification (before/after jq commands)
- Cleanup (if needed)

Mirror verification patterns from existing test utilities:
- test-voting-system.sh: jq-based JSON field verification
- test-event-polling-integration.sh: Event delivery checks
- test-spawning-safeguards.sh: Spawn tracking and circuit breaker verification

Use actual expected outputs from command documentation:
- /ant:init: 7-step progress with [✓]/[→]/[ ] indicators
- /ant:execute: 6-step progress with Worker Ant mobilization
- /ant:status: Visual dashboard with emoji indicators (🟢 ACTIVE, ⚪ IDLE, 🔴 ERROR, ⏳ PENDING)

Ensure each workflow has comprehensive coverage:
- Init workflow: State file creation, intention storage, colony status transition, Worker Ant mobilization, INIT pheromone emission, session ID generation, working memory initialization
- Execute workflow: Phase status transitions, autonomous spawning triggers, Task tool usage, Worker Ant activity updates, pheromone emission, event publishing
- Spawning workflow: Capability gap detection, specialist selection, spawn recording, Bayesian confidence updates, circuit breaker behavior, spawn depth limits, spawn budget enforcement

All verification checks must be specific and verifiable:
- Use jq commands for JSON verification
- Use file existence checks ([ -f file.json ])
- Use field value checks (jq -r '.field')
- Use count verification (jq 'length')
- Use status checks (jq '.status == "value"')

**Workflow 4: Memory (Triple-Layer Memory with DAST Compression)**
- Test 4.1: Happy Path - DAST compression triggered when working memory full
  - Steps: Fill working memory beyond capacity (10 items), observe compression to short-term memory
  - Expected output: Compression message, items moved to short-term memory, working memory count reduced
  - Verification checks (VERIF-47 through VERIF-53): working_memory.items count <= 10 after compression, short_term_memory populated, DAST compression applied (summary created, associations linked), associative_links created, memory_json working memory file updated, memory_metadata tracked, no memory loss

- Test 4.2: Failure Case - Memory overflow handling
  - Steps: Rapidly add items exceeding both working and short-term capacity
  - Expected output: Overflow handling, error or graceful degradation
  - Verification checks (VERIF-54 through VERIF-57): Memory overflow detected, error logged, colony remains stable, oldest items archived to long-term memory

- Test 4.3: Edge Case - Associative link creation during compression
  - Steps: Trigger compression with related items (same task, phase, or topic)
  - Expected output: Associative links created between related memory items
  - Verification checks (VERIF-58 through VERIF-60): associative_links array populated, links connect related items (same task_id/phase_id), association strength calculated, retrieval performance improved (same query returns related items)

**Workflow 5: Voting (Multi-Perspective Verification with Weighted Voting)**
- Test 5.1: Happy Path - Supermajority approval with weighted votes
  - Steps: Trigger verification (end of phase/task), observe 4 Watchers vote
  - Expected output: 4 Watchers (security, performance, quality, test_coverage) vote, supermajority calculated, result APPROVED or REJECTED
  - Verification checks (VERIF-61 through VERIF-68): All 4 Watchers vote, votes recorded in vote_tracking, supermajority calculated (>= 67% = APPROVED), weights applied (Critical = 2.0, Standard = 1.0), decision outcome logged, issues deduplicated (no duplicates), vote metadata recorded (timestamp, watcher), verification.last_supermajority updated

- Test 5.2: Failure Case - Critical veto blocks approval despite majority
  - Steps: 3 Watchers APPROVE, 1 Critical Watcher (security) VETOS
  - Expected output: Result REJECTED due to Critical veto
  - Verification checks (VERIF-69 through VERIF-73): Critical veto power exercised, result REJECTED despite 75% approval, security watcher veto recorded, critical_veto exercised = true, veto_reason logged

- Test 5.3: Edge Case - Weight calculation edge cases (0 watchers, abstentions)
  - Steps: Trigger verification with 0 watchers or all abstain
  - Expected output: Graceful handling, default decision or manual escalation
  - Verification checks (VERIF-74 through VERIF-77): Edge case handled, no crash, vote count = 0 or all abstain, decision logged with reason

**Workflow 6: Event (Event Polling and Delivery)**
- Test 6.1: Happy Path - Event polling retrieves events, delivery prevents reprocessing
  - Steps: Publish events, Worker Ant polls via get_events_for_subscriber(), marks delivered via mark_events_delivered(), poll again
  - Expected output: First poll returns events, second poll returns empty (already delivered)
  - Verification checks (VERIF-78 through VERIF-85): get_events_for_subscriber() returns matching events (topic filter works), events contain subscriber_id, topic, timestamp, data fields, mark_events_delivered() adds subscriber to delivered_to array, second poll returns no events (delivery tracking works), caste-specific subscriptions work (colonizer gets phase_complete, not task_started), event logging records poll, delivery_tracking updated

- Test 6.2: Failure Case - Event delivery failure (corrupted event data)
  - Steps: Publish event with invalid JSON, Worker Ant attempts to process
  - Expected output: Error logged, event not processed, colony continues
  - Verification checks (VERIF-86 through VERIF-89): Invalid event detected, error logged in event tracking, Worker Ant continues (doesn't crash), event marked as failed if applicable

- Test 6.3: Edge Case - Caste-specific filtering (different castes receive different events)
  - Steps: Publish multiple events (phase_complete, task_started, error), have colonizer and watcher poll separately
  - Expected output: Colonizer receives phase_complete + error, Watcher receives task_completed + task_failed + error
  - Verification checks (VERIF-90 through VERIF-94): Colonizer subscriptions: phase_complete, spawn_request, error, Watcher subscriptions: task_completed, task_failed, phase_complete, error, Topic filtering works (no cross-over), Event delivery is subscriber-specific, Error topic received by all castes, Subscription criteria applied correctly
