<current_state>
Phase 29 is fully planned and verified. Research, 3 PLAN.md files, and checker verification all complete. No execution has started. Ready to execute.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 29 context gathered (29-CONTEXT.md) — decisions on multi-colonizer, wave parallelism, scoring rubric
- Phase 29 research completed (29-RESEARCH.md) — all 6 requirements are prompt engineering changes to colonize.md, build.md, watcher-ant.md
- Plan 29-01: Multi-colonizer synthesis + complexity mode detection (2 tasks, Wave 1)
- Plan 29-02: Watcher scoring rubric with weighted dimensions (1 task, Wave 1)
- Plan 29-03: Aggressive wave parallelism + auto-approval + mode-aware build (2 tasks, Wave 2)
- Plan checker verification passed — all 6 dimensions clean
- ROADMAP.md updated with plan entries
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Execute Plan 29-01: Multi-colonizer synthesis + complexity detection in colonize.md (Wave 1)
- Execute Plan 29-02: Watcher scoring rubric in watcher-ant.md (Wave 1)
- Execute Plan 29-03: Wave parallelism + auto-approval in build.md (Wave 2, depends on 29-01)
- Verify Phase 29 after execution
- Update STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md on completion
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- 3 colonizer ants with distinct specialization lenses (Structure, Patterns, Stack) for reduced blind spots
- Disagreements between colonizers flagged explicitly in synthesis report — user decides
- Watcher scoring rubric: 5 weighted dimensions (Correctness 0.30, Completeness 0.25, Quality 0.20, Safety 0.15, Integration 0.10)
- Chain-of-thought evaluation mandate to improve score discrimination
- Colony complexity mode (LIGHTWEIGHT/STANDARD/FULL) based on file count, directory depth, language count
- LIGHTWEIGHT skips multi-colonizer and watcher verification, auto-approves all plans
- FULL enables aggressive parallelism but always requires user approval
- Wave parallelism defaults to parallel (DEFAULT-PARALLEL RULE) — tasks only sequential if file overlap or explicit dependency
- Plans 01 and 02 run in parallel Wave 1 (no file overlap); Plan 03 in Wave 2 (needs mode field from 01)

<context>
Phase 29 covers 6 requirements (INT-01, INT-03, INT-04, INT-05, INT-07, ARCH-03) — all prompt engineering changes to existing command files. No new scripts or infrastructure needed. The key architectural thread is that colonize.md sets the complexity mode in COLONY_STATE.json, and build.md reads it for auto-approval and watcher behavior — this is why Plan 03 depends on Plan 01. STATE.md still shows Phase 28 as current — update it to reflect Phase 29 planned status on resume.
