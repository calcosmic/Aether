<objective>
Create consolidated workers.md file containing all 6 worker role definitions.

Purpose: Reduce 1,866 lines of duplicated worker specs to ~200 lines of essential content
Output: Single .aether/workers.md file with shared section + 6 role definitions

Read all 6 worker files. For each role, extract ONLY:
- Purpose statement (compress to 2 sentences max)
- Workflow hints (compress to 3-5 bullet points)
- Role-specific emoji identity

DO NOT extract (per CONTEXT.md decisions):
- Pheromone math instructions (28 lines each) - removed per SIMP-03
- Sensitivity tables (8 lines each) - replaced by keyword list
- Combination effects tables (12 lines each) - trust Claude
- Feedback interpretation tables (12 lines each) - trust Claude
- Event awareness protocol (20 lines each) - workers read what they need
- Memory reading protocol (20 lines each) - workers read what they need
- Post-action validation checklist (25 lines each) - removed per CONTEXT.md
- Visual identity verbose template (32 lines each) - keep emoji only

Document the extracted content in working notes before writing the file.

Create `.aether/workers.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Worker Roles

## All Workers

### Activity Log
[5 lines: bash command pattern and when to use]

### Spawn Requests
[10 lines: format, caste list with emoji, depth rules]

### Visual Identity
[5 lines: emoji list, usage in output headers]

### Output Format
[10 lines: simplified template per CONTEXT.md]
Task: {what}
Status: completed / failed / blocked
Summary: {1-2 sentences}
Files: {only if touched}
Next Steps / Recommendations: {required}

## Builder
[emoji] Purpose: [2 sentences]
When to use: [1 line]
Signals: FOCUS, REDIRECT
Workflow: [3-5 bullets]

## Watcher
[emoji] Purpose: [2 sentences - INCLUDE quality gate role]
When to use: [1 line]
Signals: FOCUS, FEEDBACK
Workflow: [5-8 bullets - more for quality gate specifics]

## Scout
[same pattern ~25 lines]

## Colonizer
[same pattern ~25 lines]

## Architect
[same pattern ~25 lines]

## Route-Setter
[same pattern ~25 lines]
```

Per-role signal keywords (derived from old sensitivity tables):
- Builder: FOCUS, REDIRECT (both high sensitivity 0.9)
- Watcher: FOCUS, FEEDBACK (quality focus)
- Scout: FOCUS, INIT (information gathering)
- Colonizer: INIT, FOCUS (exploration)
- Architect: FEEDBACK (synthesis)
- Route-Setter: REDIRECT, FEEDBACK (planning adjustments)

Watcher section: Add 3-5 extra lines to preserve quality gate role:
- Mention mandatory review before phase advancement
- Include quality checklist concept (not 45-line rubric)
- Note that watcher approves/blocks phase completion
  </action>
  <verify>
wc -l .aether/workers.md

Target: 150-250 lines (ideally ~200)
If over 250, compress further. If under 150, ensure nothing essential was lost.

<success_criteria>
- Single workers.md file contains all 6 role definitions
- File is ~200 lines (90% reduction from 1,866)
- Structure matches CONTEXT.md decisions (shared section + per-role)
- Ready for command integration in Plan 02
