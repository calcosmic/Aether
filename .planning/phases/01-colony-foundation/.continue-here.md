Working on Phase 1: Colony Foundation - State & Command Infrastructure

We just completed a major terminology update and architecture transfer:
- Renamed all Worker Ant castes to more evocative names
- Transferred architectural information from Python files to Claude-native prompts
- Updated all documentation and command files

The phase is still in planning stage - no actual implementation has begun yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Architecture & Terminology Updates:**
- Renamed "Mapper" → "Colonizer" (colonizes codebase)
- Renamed "Planner" → "Route-setter" (sets routes for colony)
- Renamed "Executor" → "Builder" (builds and implements)
- Renamed "Verifier" → "Watcher" (watches over quality)
- Renamed "Researcher" → "Scout" (scouts for information)
- Renamed "Synthesizer" → "Architect" (architects knowledge)

**Files Updated:**
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Updated all caste references
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Updated caste descriptions
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` - Updated caste listings
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Documented all changes
- `.claude/commands/ant/init.md` - Comprehensive caste profiles and spawning mechanics
- `.claude/commands/ant/status.md` - Complete caste information
- `.claude/commands/ant/execute.md` - Autonomous spawning decision flow
- `.claude/commands/ant/focus.md` - Signal decay and sensitivity profiles
- `.claude/commands/ant/redirect.md` - Constraint creation lifecycle
- `.claude/commands/ant/feedback.md` - Feedback categories and learning
- `.claude/commands/ant/phase.md` - Task assignment mappings
- `.claude/commands/ant/colonize.md` - Agent spawning references
- `.claude/commands/ant/ant.md` - System overview
- `.aether/QUEEN_ANT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Updated caste descriptions and ASCII art
- `.aether/HANDOFF.md` - Updated workflow examples
- `README.md` - Updated caste examples

**Architecture Information Transferred from Python:**
- Autonomous spawning mechanics (capability detection, taxonomy, specialist mappings)
- Resource budget constraints (max 10 subagents, depth 3, circuit breakers)
- Pheromone system details (signal decay formulas, sensitivity profiles)
- Caste-specific behaviors and response patterns
- Learning thresholds and constraint creation systems
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Phase 1 Tasks (8 total):**
- [ ] 01-01: Create colony state schema (COLONY_STATE.json) with goal, status, phases, Worker Ants, pheromones, memory
- [ ] 01-02: Create pheromone signal schema (pheromones.json) with type, strength, created_at, decay_rate
- [ ] 01-03: Create Worker Ant state schema (worker_ants.json) with caste, status, current_task, spawns
- [ ] 01-04: Create memory schema (memory.json) with working, short-term, long-term memory
- [ ] 01-05: Implement file locking mechanism for concurrent colony access prevention
- [ ] 01-06: Implement atomic write pattern (temp file + rename) for colony state corruption safety
- [ ] 01-07: Create `/ant:init` command prompt (Queen sets intention, colony mobilizes)
- [ ] 01-08: Create `/ant:status` command prompt (Queen observes colony state)

**Important Notes:**
- The Python files (.aether/*.py) contain important architectural information that must be preserved
- All command prompts should be Claude-native, not ported from Python
- Aether is a unique, standalone system - not dependent on CDS or any external framework

**Pending Todos (Added This Session):**
1. Ensure flag system for 3-attempt failure detection (error prevention)
2. Create Agent files and template files for each Worker Ant caste (reference superpowers system for templates but make uniquely Aether)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Terminology**: Updated all caste names to be more evocative and descriptive
- **Architecture Transfer**: Preserved all important architectural information from Python files and transferred to Claude-native prompts
- **Standalone System**: Emphasized that Aether is unique and not dependent on CDS or other frameworks
- **Claude-Native**: All implementations are prompt-based, not ported from Python
</decisions_made>

<attempted_approaches>
<!-- CRITICAL: What was tried that didn't work -->

- **Direct file editing without comprehensive updates**: Initially updated some caste names but missed comprehensive context transfer
  - **Result**: Lost important architectural information from Python files
  - **Why it failed**: Focused on renaming without preserving the detailed architectural specifications
  - **Learning**: The Python files contain crucial implementation details that must be transferred to Claude-native prompts

- **Removing Python file references entirely**: Initially removed all Python file references from command files
  - **Result**: Lost important architectural information
  - **Why it failed**: User pointed out these files contained important information that should be transferred, not deleted
  - **Learning**: Transfer and transform, don't delete - extract the architectural patterns and adapt them to Claude-native form
</attempted_approaches>

<dead_ends>
<!-- Approaches that should NOT be retried -->

| Approach | Why It Won't Work | Don't Retry Because |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Copying CDS templates directly | Aether must be unique, not dependent on CDS | Aether is its own framework with unique pheromone-based architecture |
| Porting Python implementation to prompts | Loses the architectural intent, becomes mechanical translation | Aether needs Claude-native design from first principles |
| Using generic agent names | Loses the evocative nature of the system | "Colonizer, Route-setter, Builder, Watcher, Scout, Architect" are meaningful and memorable |
| Removing Mapper name entirely | Lost the colonization concept which is core to the caste | Colonizer is the better name - it actively colonizes territory (codebase) |
</dead_ends>

<blockers>

- **Blocker 1**: Need to create flag system for 3-attempt failure detection
  - Status: Not started, documented as todo
  - Workaround: Will implement in upcoming tasks

- **Blocker 2**: Need to create Agent template files for each caste
  - Status: Not started, documented as todo
  - Workaround: Reference /Users/callumcowie/repos/superpowers for templates but must be uniquely Aether
</blockers>

<context>
**Mental State:**
The system is in a good place now - we have:
1. ✅ Renamed all castes to more evocative names
2. ✅ Transferred comprehensive architectural information from Python to Claude-native prompts
3. ✅ Updated all documentation consistently
4. ✅ Established Aether as a unique standalone system

**The Vision:**
Aether is a revolutionary multi-agent system where:
- Worker Ants autonomously spawn other Worker Ants (no other system does this)
- Queen provides intention via pheromones (not commands)
- Colony self-organizes with pure emergence within structured phases
- Six unique castes: Colonizer, Route-setter, Builder, Watcher, Scout, Architect

**Next Phase Focus:**
Need to begin Phase 1 implementation tasks - starting with the state schemas and command infrastructure.
</context>

<next_action>
**First action when resuming:**

1. Review the two pending todos:
   - Flag system for 3-attempt failure detection
   - Agent template files from superpowers (rebranded for Aether)

2. Start Phase 1 implementation with task 01-01: Create colony state schema (COLONY_STATE.json)

**Key files to reference:**
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Full phase breakdown
- `.claude/commands/ant/init.md` - Comprehensive architectural context
- `.aether/QUEEN_ANT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture documentation
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - All v1 requirements mapped to phases

**Command to resume:** /cds:resume-work
