Phase 1: Colony Foundation - COMPLETED

All 8 tasks have been completed successfully. The colony state infrastructure is now in place.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Phase 1 Tasks Completed:**

✅ **01-01: Colony State Schema** (COLONY_STATE.json)
- Created comprehensive colony state schema with metadata, queen intention, state machine, resource budgets, phases, meta-learning, checkpoints, events, and performance metrics
- Location: `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json`

✅ **01-02: Pheromone Signal Schema** (pheromones.json)
- Created pheromone system with INIT, FOCUS, REDIRECT, FEEDBACK signal types
- Includes half-life definitions, caste sensitivity profiles, effective strength calculations
- Location: `.aether/data/pheromones.json`

✅ **01-03: Worker Ant State Schema** (worker_ants.json)
- Created complete Worker Ant caste definitions with new names (colonizer, route_setter, builder, watcher, specialist, architect)
- Includes capabilities, sensitivity profiles, spawn data, performance metrics
- Location: `.aether/data/worker_ants.json`

✅ **01-04: Memory Schema** (memory.json)
- Created triple-layer memory schema (working, short-term, long-term)
- Includes DAST compression (2.5x ratio), LRU eviction, pattern extraction, associative linking
- Location: `.aether/data/memory.json`

✅ **01-05: File Locking Mechanism**
- Created file-lock.sh utility for concurrent colony access prevention
- Uses flock for exclusive file locking with timeout and stale lock cleanup
- Location: `.aether/utils/file-lock.sh`

✅ **01-06: Atomic Write Pattern**
- Created atomic-write.sh utility for corruption-safe state updates
- Uses temp file + atomic rename with backup rotation
- Includes JSON validation and disk sync
- Location: `.aether/utils/atomic-write.sh`

✅ **01-07: /ant:init Command**
- Updated /ant:init command to initialize colony with Queen's intention
- Creates INIT pheromone, mobilizes all Worker Ants, initializes memory
- Uses atomic writes for all state updates
- Location: `.claude/commands/ant/init.md`

✅ **01-08: /ant:status Command**
- Updated /ant:status command to show comprehensive colony status
- Displays Worker Ant activity, pheromones, phase progress, memory status, performance metrics
- Location: `.claude/commands/ant/status.md`

**Utilities Created:**
- `.aether/utils/file-lock.sh` - File locking for concurrent access prevention
- `.aether/utils/atomic-write.sh` - Atomic writes with backup rotation

**Data Files Created:**
- `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json` - Main colony state
- `.aether/data/pheromones.json` - Pheromone signals
- `.aether/data/worker_ants.json` - Worker Ant castes
- `.aether/data/memory.json` - Triple-layer memory

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE.**

Next: Phase 2 - Worker Ant Castes
- Create Worker Ant prompt files for each caste
- Implement Task tool spawning pattern with context inheritance
- Create /ant:phase command prompt
- Create /ant:execute command prompt

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **JSON State Persistence**: Using JSON files for all state storage, as specified in requirements
- **Atomic Writes**: All state updates use temp file + atomic rename to prevent corruption
- **File Locking**: Using flock-based locking for concurrent access prevention
- **Caste Names**: Using new descriptive names (colonizer, route_setter, builder, watcher, scout, architect)
- **Pheromone System**: Four signal types (INIT, FOCUS, REDIRECT, FEEDBACK) with proper decay rates

</decisions_made>

<context>

**Aether v2 Philosophy:**
- Emergence Over Orchestration - No predefined workflows, colony self-organizes
- Stigmergy - Pheromone signals as communication medium
- Autonomous Spawning - Workers spawn Workers (core innovation)
- Structure at boundaries, emergence within - Phase checkpoints, pure emergence during execution

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Phase 2: Worker Ant Castes
- Create prompt files for each Worker Ant caste
- Implement Task tool spawning pattern
- Create /ant:phase and /ant:execute commands

**Key files for next phase:**
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Full phase breakdown
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` - All requirements mapped to phases
- `.aether/QUEEN_ANT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture

</context>

<next_action>

**Phase 1 Complete!**

The colony foundation is now in place:
- ✅ State schemas created
- ✅ File locking implemented
- ✅ Atomic writes implemented
- ✅ Core commands (/ant:init, /ant:status) updated

**Ready for Phase 2: Worker Ant Castes**

To continue:
1. Review Phase 2 tasks in ROADMAP.md
2. Start implementing Worker Ant prompt files
3. Create /ant:phase command
4. Create /ant:execute command

**Command to continue:** /cds:resume-work
