# Continue Here: Phase 4 Complete

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Phase 4 Complete and Verified

## What Was Completed

Phase 4: Triple-Layer Memory — **5/5 plans executed and verified**

1. **04-01**: Working Memory operations (add/get/update/list) with LRU eviction at 80% capacity
2. **04-02**: DAST compression prompt pattern (2.5x ratio) in Architect Ant
3. **04-03**: Long-term Memory pattern extraction with associative links and confidence scoring
4. **04-04**: Phase boundary compression triggers (token threshold, pattern extraction)
5. **04-05**: Cross-layer search with relevance ranking and /ant:memory command

## Verification Status

**Score:** 15/15 must-haves verified
**Status:** PASSED
**Report:** `04-triple-layer-memory-VERIFICATION.md`

## Next Phase

**Phase 5: Phase Boundaries** — Colony operates through explicit state machine with phase boundaries, checkpoints, and recovery capability

## To Continue

Run `/cds:discuss-phase 5` to gather context and clarify approach for Phase 5

**IMPORTANT:** Clear context (`/clear`) before continuing to fresh context window.
