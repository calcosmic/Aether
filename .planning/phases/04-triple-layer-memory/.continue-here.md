# Continue Here: Phase 4 - Triple-Layer Memory

**Phase:** 04 - Triple-Layer Memory
**Status:** Ready to begin
**Date:** 2026-02-01

## What Was Completed

Phase 3 (Pheromone Communication) is complete:
- ✅ /ant:focus command (FOCUS pheromone, 1-hour decay)
- ✅ /ant:redirect command (REDIRECT pheromone, 24-hour decay)
- ✅ /ant:feedback command (FEEDBACK pheromone, 6-hour decay)
- ✅ All 6 Worker Ants have pheromone reading and interpretation sections
- ✅ Caste-specific sensitivity profiles documented
- ✅ Effective strength calculation (signal × sensitivity) documented
- ✅ Verification passed (8/8 must-haves)

## Next Steps

Phase 4 will implement the Triple-Layer Memory system:

**Goal:** Colony memory compresses across three layers (Working → Short-term → Long-term) preventing context rot and enabling retrieval

**Planned Work (10 tasks):**
1. Implement Working Memory schema in memory.json
2. Implement Working Memory read/write/update operations
3. Implement LRU eviction policy for Working Memory
4. Implement DAST compression algorithm prompt
5. Implement Short-term Memory schema
6. Implement Short-term Memory LRU eviction
7. Implement Long-term Memory schema
8. Implement phase boundary compression trigger
9. Implement pattern extraction trigger
10. Implement cross-layer search with relevance ranking

## Resume Command

```bash
/cds:execute-phase 04
```

Or first discuss the phase approach:

```bash
/cds:discuss-phase 04
```

## Context

- **Progress:** 30% complete (3 of 10 phases)
- **Current State:** Colony can coordinate through stigmergic pheromone signals
- **Next Capability:** Triple-layer memory for knowledge persistence across sessions
