<current_state>
Phase 26 (File Audit) is COMPLETE. All 4 plans executed and verified. Post-phase work also done: .aether/ root reorganization and colony branding pass across build.md and continue.md commands.

v1.4 milestone has phases 27-30 remaining in the roadmap but they haven't been planned yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 26 plans 01-04: All executed and verified (done before this session)
- .aether/ root reorganization: Moved 8 docs to subdirectories (disciplines/, docs/), root went from 19 to 9 files
- manifest.json: Regenerated with 73 accurate checksums (was massively stale)
- docs/README.md: Updated with new disciplines/ and architecture sections
- dreams/FUTURE-IDEAS.md: Created, organizing 12 ideas from 4 dream journals
- Colony branding (continue.md): All verification loop and gate outputs branded with ant emojis, spaced-letter headers, thick/thin borders
- Colony branding (build.md): Survey, wisdom, signals, archaeology, spawn plan, spawn announcements, wave separators, verification, chaos, visual checkpoint all branded
- All changes mirrored to both .claude/commands/ant/ and .opencode/commands/ant/
- 3 commits pushed: 705a1c4 (reorg), 8a47ca7 (continue branding), bbc6bef (build branding)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Phases 27-30 not yet planned or executed
- Phase 27: Clean .aether/docs/ — reduce to 8-10 actively-maintained docs
- Phase 28: Clean Planning Directories — index docs/plans/, decide on worktree-salvage
- Phase 29: Fix Bash Bug & Root Cleanup — fix line wrapping, clean repo root
- Phase 30: Verify & Document — test commands, update README, create repo-structure.md
- Pre-existing debt: Content-level command drift between Claude/OpenCode (35 files), 2 validate-state test failures
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Reorganized .aether/ by moving discipline docs and architecture doc into subdirectories rather than deleting
- Created FUTURE-IDEAS.md in dreams/ to preserve all future vision from dream journals
- Colony branding style: thick borders (━━━) for major sections, thin borders (────) for spawn announcements, spaced letters for headers, ant emoji (🐜) on everything
- Both command platforms always updated simultaneously

<context>
User was frustrated that .aether/ still looked cluttered after Phase 26. Did deeper manual reorganization beyond what plans covered. Then noticed colony output had lost its personality — verification reports and build spawn announcements were plain text with no ant emojis or branded borders. Applied consistent colony visual identity across all output templates in both build.md and continue.md.

The repo is in good shape: 483 files (down from 592 at v1.1), 131 commits of improvements, 21 bugs fixed, clean .aether/ root.

<next_action>
Start with: /gsd:plan-phase 27 to plan the next cleanup phase, or /gsd:progress to review overall state. User may also want to take a different direction entirely — the cleanup phases 27-30 are optional and the repo is already significantly cleaner.
