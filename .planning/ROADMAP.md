</details>

## Phase Details

### Phase 38: Security Gates

**Goal:** Add professional security and quality gates to verification phase

**Depends on:** Phase 37 (v4.0 complete)

**Requirements:** SEC-01 through SEC-06

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Gatekeeper spawns when package manifest exists — CVE scan, license compliance
2. Gatekeeper blocks on critical CVEs, warns on high
3. Auditor spawns when UI/API changes detected — multi-lens review
4. Auditor gate fails if quality score < 60 or critical findings exist
5. Both agents are read-only (no code modification)

**Why this matters:** Current security scan is just a grep. This adds professional supply chain security.

---

### Phase 39: Quality Coverage

**Goal:** Improve test coverage and establish performance baselines

**Depends on:** Phase 38

**Requirements:** COV-01 through COV-07

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Probe spawns when coverage < 80% after tests pass
2. Probe generates tests, discovers edge cases, non-blocking
3. Measurer spawns for performance-sensitive phases
4. Measurer establishes baselines, identifies bottlenecks
5. Performance findings logged to midden for future reference

**Why this matters:** Coverage gaps compound silently. Performance issues are harder to fix later.

---

### Phase 40: Lifecycle Enhancement

**Goal:** Ensure documentation coverage and better API integrations

**Depends on:** Phase 39

**Requirements:** LIF-01 through LIF-06

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Chronicler spawns before seal ceremony — documentation coverage audit
2. Chronicler reports gaps but doesn't block (non-blocking)
3. Ambassador replaces Builder for external API/SDK tasks
4. Ambassador handles OAuth, rate limiting, circuit breakers
5. Ambassador returns integration plan for Builder to execute

**Why this matters:** External integrations are failure-prone. Documentation debt compounds silently.

---

### Phase 41: Analytics & Improvement

**Goal:** Add colony analytics and proactive refactoring

**Depends on:** Phase 40

**Requirements:** ANA-01 through ANA-06

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Sage spawns when colony has 3+ completed phases
2. Sage provides velocity trends, bug density, review turnaround
3. Weaver spawns when complexity exceeds thresholds
4. Weaver refactors and runs tests — reverts if break
5. Both agents provide insights without blocking

**Why this matters:** Data-driven insights improve colony wisdom. Proactive refactoring prevents tech debt.

## Requirement Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| MEM-01 | 36 | /ant:continue asks for learnings → writes to QUEEN.md | Complete    | 2026-02-21 | 36 | /ant:build logs failures to midden + learning-observe |
| MEM-03 | 36 | Lower promotion threshold to 1 + user approval |
| LOG-01 | 37 | Workers update CHANGELOG.md during work | Complete    | 2026-02-21 | 37 | /ant:resume shows learnings, failures, wisdom |
| VIS-02 | 37 | /ant:status shows memory health |

**Coverage:** 6/6 requirements mapped ✓
- v1 requirements (P1 Core): 4/4
- v2 requirements (P2 Enhancements): 2/2

---

## Architecture Alignment

**Principle:** Wire the existing memory systems together. No new infrastructure.

| Component | v4.0 Enhancement |
|-----------|------------------|
| `/ant:continue` | Asks "What did you learn?" → writes to QUEEN.md |
| `/ant/build` | Logs failures to midden/ + learning-observe |
| `learning-observe` | Called automatically on failure (not just manually) |
| `queen-promote` | Threshold 1 + approval (not 5) |
| `QUEEN.md` | Actually gets populated now |
| `colony-prime` | Reads populated QUEEN.md (already works) |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | New — continuously updated by workers |

---

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New pheromone types | Existing signals work |
| Decay mechanisms | Explicit logging is simpler |
| NEST.md, TRAILS/, BROOD/ | Over-engineering |
| Complex documentation | QUEEN.md + CHANGELOG.md is enough |
