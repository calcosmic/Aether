## Phase Details

### Phase 42: Fix Update Bugs

**Goal:** Update system writes files atomically and reports accurate counts

**Depends on:** Phase 41 (v5.0 complete)

**Requirements:** UPDATE-01, UPDATE-02, UPDATE-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Files are written atomically (temp file + rename) in syncDirWithCleanup
2. Dry-run mode reports 0 files copied (not counting skipped files)
3. Old directories (.aether/agents/, .aether/commands/) are cleaned from user repos
4. Update completes without partial file corruption on interrupt

**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 42-01-PLAN.md — Fix atomic writes (UPDATE-01) and counter bug (UPDATE-02)
- [ ] 42-02-PLAN.md — Extend stale directory cleanup (UPDATE-03)

---

### Phase 43: Make Learning Flow

**Goal:** Learning observations flow through pipeline to QUEEN.md automatically

**Depends on:** Phase 42

**Requirements:** FLOW-01, FLOW-02, FLOW-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. learning-observations.json is auto-created if missing during /ant:init
2. Observations recorded during builds accumulate in learning-observations.json
3. Thresholds trigger promotion proposals automatically
4. User sees tick-to-approve UI with proposals meeting thresholds
5. Approved proposals appear in QUEEN.md with correct formatting
6. colony-prime includes promoted wisdom in worker context

**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

---

### Phase 44: Suggest Pheromones

**Goal:** System suggests pheromones based on codebase analysis at build start

**Depends on:** Phase 43

**Requirements:** SUGG-01, SUGG-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Build start analyzes codebase for patterns worth signaling
2. User sees suggested pheromones with tick-to-approve UI
3. Approved suggestions are written as FOCUS signals
4. Suggestions are based on actual code analysis (not random)
5. User can dismiss suggestions without approving

**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 44-01-PLAN.md — Create suggest-analyze command for codebase analysis (SUGG-02)
- [ ] 44-02-PLAN.md — Create suggest-approve tick-to-approve UI (SUGG-01)
- [ ] 44-03-PLAN.md — Integrate suggestions into build.md Step 4.2 (SUGG-01, SUGG-02)
- [ ] 44-04-PLAN.md — Integration tests for pheromone suggestion system (SUGG-01, SUGG-02)

---

### Phase 38: Security Gates

**Goal:** Add professional security and quality gates to verification phase

**Depends on:** Phase 37 (v4.0 complete)

**Requirements:** SEC-01 through SEC-06

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Gatekeeper spawns when package manifest exists — CVE scan, license compliance
2. Gatekeeper blocks on critical CVEs, warns on high
3. Auditor spawns when UI/API changes detected — multi-lens review
4. Auditor gate fails if quality score < 60 or critical findings exist
5. Both agents are read-only (no code modification)

**Why this matters:** Current security scan is just a grep. This adds professional supply chain security.

---

### Phase 39: Quality Coverage

**Goal:** Improve test coverage and establish performance baselines

**Depends on:** Phase 38

**Requirements:** COV-01 through COV-07

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Probe spawns when coverage < 80% after tests pass
2. Probe generates tests, discovers edge cases, non-blocking
3. Measurer spawns for performance-sensitive phases
4. Measurer establishes baselines, identifies bottlenecks
5. Performance findings logged to midden for future reference

**Why this matters:** Coverage gaps compound silently. Performance issues are harder to fix later.

---

### Phase 40: Lifecycle Enhancement

**Goal:** Ensure documentation coverage and better API integrations

**Depends on:** Phase 39

**Requirements:** LIF-01 through LIF-06

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Chronicler spawns in /ant:seal Step 5.5 before ceremony display
2. Chronicler surveys documentation coverage (API docs, READMEs, guides)
3. Chronicler reports gaps but doesn't block seal
4. Ambassador replaces Builder when task involves external API/SDK/OAuth
5. Ambassador handles rate limiting, circuit breakers, retry patterns
6. Ambassador returns integration plan for Builder to execute

**Why this matters:** External integrations are failure-prone. Documentation debt compounds silently.

---

### Phase 41: Analytics & Improvement

**Goal:** Add colony analytics and proactive refactoring

**Depends on:** Phase 40

**Requirements:** ANA-01 through ANA-06

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. Sage spawns in /ant:seal Step 3.5 when colony has 3+ completed phases
2. Sage analyzes velocity trends, bug density, review turnaround
3. Sage provides data-driven insights to wisdom promotion process
4. Weaver spawns in /ant:continue Step 1.7 when complexity exceeds thresholds
5. Weaver refactors code to improve maintainability
6. Weaver runs tests before and after — reverts if break

**Why this matters:** Data-driven insights improve colony wisdom. Proactive refactoring prevents tech debt.

## Architecture Alignment

### v6.0 Philosophy

**Wire existing systems, don't add new ones.**

The functions exist — they just need to be connected:

| Component | Current State | v6.0 Fix |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| syncDirWithCleanup | Direct copy, no atomicity | Temp file + rename pattern |
| Dry-run counter | Counts skipped files | Only count actual copies |
| Stale directories | Partial cleanup | Complete cleanup of old dirs |
| learning-observations.json | Created on first observe | Auto-create in /ant:init |
| Learning pipeline | Observations recorded but not checked | Check thresholds after recording |
| Pheromone suggestions | None | Analyze and suggest at build start |
