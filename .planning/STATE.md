# STATE — v6.0 System Integration

> Wire existing systems together — no new features, just integration

---

## Project Reference

**Core Value**: Aether prevents context rot across Claude Code sessions with self-managing colony that learns and guides users

**Current Focus**: Fix integration gaps in update system, learning pipeline, and pheromone suggestions.

**Milestone Goal**: Existing functions work together — no new features, just wiring.

---

## Current Position

**Phase**: None (roadmap just created)
**Plan**: None
**Status**: Ready to start Phase 42

**Progress**: 0/3 phases complete

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Plans | Completed |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|

| 43. Make Learning Flow | Not started | 0/3 | - |
| 44. Suggest Pheromones | Not started | 0/2 | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

1. **Wire, don't build** — Use existing functions rather than creating new ones
2. **Phase 42 starts at 42** — Continuing from v5.0 which ended at Phase 41
3. **Three phases only** — Deep integration over broad coverage

### Open Questions

1. Should pheromone suggestions run before or after colony-prime?
2. How many suggestions to show at once?
3. Should failed observations auto-promote or require approval?

### Known Risks

1. **Update system touches many files** — Risk of breaking existing installs
2. **Learning pipeline has timing issues** — When exactly to check thresholds?
3. **Pheromone suggestions could be noisy** — Need to tune signal-to-noise

---

## Blockers

None. Ready to begin Phase 42.

---

## Session Continuity

**Last Action**: Created roadmap for v6.0
**Next Action**: Run `/gsd:plan-phase 42` to create detailed plan for Fix Update Bugs
**Context Freshness**: Current
