## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Summary

**v3.0 decisions:**
- No new Python, bash scripts, or commands — restore via JSON state + enriched prompts + deeper specs
- 4-phase structure: Visual Identity -> Infrastructure State -> Worker Knowledge -> Integration & Dashboard
- Worker specs target ~200 lines each (from ~90 now)
- Specialist watcher modes folded into watcher-ant.md (not separate files)
- events.json is a log (not a queue) — workers filter by timestamp
