# Project State

**Project:** Aether
**Core Value:** Context preservation, clear workflow guidance, self-improving colony

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 11 — Visual Identity
Plan: 02 (Named Worker Display) — READY
Status: Executing phase 11
Last activity: 2026-02-18 — Plan 11-01 complete (caste single source of truth)

Progress: ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 25% (1 of 4 plans complete)

## Current Status

- **State:** Executing
- **Milestone:** v1.1 Colony Polish & Identity
- **Mode:** YOLO (auto-approve)
- **Next action:** `/gsd:execute-phase 11` (continue Plan 11-02)

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** Prevent context rot across Claude Code sessions with self-managing colony that learns and guides users

**Current focus:** v1.1 Colony Polish & Identity — reduce bash noise, unified visual language, build progress indicators, reliable distribution

## Progress

- [x] v1.0 Repair & Stabilization — 9 phases, 27 plans, 46/46 requirements PASS (shipped 2026-02-18)
- [ ] v1.1 Colony Polish & Identity — 4 phases defined, Phase 10 next

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
- Phase 10 (noise) before Phase 11 (visual): no point polishing output text if 30+ tool call headers still dominate
- Phase 11 (visual) before Phase 12 (progress): visual language must be defined before adding new output patterns
- Phase 13 (distribution) independent of visual work — grouped last to keep visual changes batched
- Avoid ANSI color codes — Claude Code strips them; use unicode + emoji only
- Do not consolidate continue.md verification gates — each step needs independent failure visibility
- Only combine truly atomic bash operations — error isolation is more important than header count
- Technical identifiers (session_id, build_id) hidden from normal output but preserved internally for logging/debugging
- Verbose mode retains detailed output (git checkpoint hash) since user opted into detailed view
- [Phase 10-noise-reduction]: generate-ant-name calls preserved as separate - each returns unique name needed independently
- [Phase 10-noise-reduction]: Archive operations kept separate for error visibility on precious data
- [Phase 10-noise-reduction]: Bash description format: "Run using the Bash tool with description \"action...\": - colony-flavored language, 4-8 words, trailing ellipsis
- [Phase 10-noise-reduction]: Spawn-tracking consolidation (spawn-log + display-update + context-update) reduces visible headers by ~40%
- [Phase 10-noise-reduction]: High-complexity commands (build.md: 57 calls, continue.md: 27 calls) now have human-readable descriptions on all bash calls
- [Phase 11-visual-identity]: Canonical caste-system.md as single source of truth; other files reference, never duplicate
- [Phase 11-visual-identity]: colonizer canonical emoji is 🗺️🐜 (not 🌱🐜); route_setter canonical emoji is 📋🐜 (not 🧭🐜)

### Key Findings from Research
- Typical /ant:build generates 22-42 visible bash tool call headers — root cause of "bash stuff" feeling
- Visual display subsystems (swarm display, named ants, caste emojis) already exist but are buried under noise
- Caste emoji defined in 3 separate places with inconsistent mappings — Phase 11 unifies to one source
- Version-matching bug in /ant:update causes unnecessary re-syncs — fix with pending file pattern
- Sub-agent tool calls are visible but outside Queen-level command file control — Phase 10 reduces Queen-level noise only

### Risks to Watch
- Bash call consolidation must not break error isolation (BUG-005 lock deadlock exists)
- Description field behavior in Claude Code should be verified before Phase 10 bulk implementation
- Swarm display is designed for tmux context — Phase 12 routes display calls to tmux-only path

## Last Updated

2026-02-18 — Phase 10 complete (4 plans, bash descriptions on 112 total commands across 34 colony commands, ~40% header reduction in high-complexity commands through spawn-tracking consolidation)
2026-02-18 — Phase 11 Plan 01 complete (caste-system.md canonical file created, CLAUDE.md and workers.md tables replaced with references, duplicate get_caste_emoji() removed from aether-utils.sh, dreamer case added to global function)
