# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** The oracle produces research you can act on -- verified, iteratively deepened, structured for the topic.
**Current focus:** Phase 6 -- State Architecture Foundation

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Oracle Deep Research
Phase: 6 of 11 (State Architecture Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Planned (2 plans, 2 waves, verified)
Last activity: 2026-03-13 -- Phase 6 planned and verified

Progress: [          ] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Velocity (reference):**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: 3.3min
- Total execution time: 0.61 hours

**v1.1:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- Research recommends: state schema first, then iteration prompts, then orchestrator -- strict dependency chain
- Phase 9 (Trust) and Phase 10 (Steering) can be parallel -- both depend on Phase 8, not each other
- Colony integration (Phase 11) deferred last -- requires all other systems stable

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Verify `--json-schema` Claude CLI flag availability early in Phase 7 -- fallback to prompt-based JSON enforcement if unavailable
- Convergence threshold numbers need empirical tuning in Phase 8 -- start with research recommendations, iterate
- Colony integration API (Phase 11) needs deliberate design session before implementation
