## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Summary

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**v4.4 decisions:**
- 27-01: Used jq max/min for decay clamping, cp instead of mv for log archiving, regex validation for phase arg
- 27-02: CONFLICT PREVENTION RULE after caste sensitivity table, sub-step 2b for Queen backup, two-point decision logging (strategic + quality), 30-entry cap

### Pending Todos

None.

### Open Issues

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CP-1: Recursive spawning may be blocked by Claude Code platform constraint (Task tool unavailable to subagents). Must validate in Phase 31 before implementing spawn tree engine.
