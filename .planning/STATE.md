**Core value:** Stigmergic Emergence -- Worker Ants detect capability gaps and spawn specialists through pheromone-guided coordination
**Current focus:** v4.4 Colony Hardening & Real-World Readiness

## Current Position

Milestone: v4.4 Colony Hardening & Real-World Readiness

Plan: 2 of 3 complete (29-01 + 29-02 done, wave 1 complete)
Status: In progress — 29-01 multi-colonizer synthesis + 29-02 watcher scoring rubric complete
Last activity: 2026-02-05 -- Completed 29-01-PLAN.md (multi-colonizer synthesis & complexity mode)

Progress: [########------------] 40% (v4.4: 2/6 phases, 6/12 plans est.)

**Previous milestones:**

- v2.0 Shipped (2026-02-02): 3 phases, 6 plans, event polling + visual indicators + E2E testing
- v3.0 Shipped (2026-02-03): 4 phases, 11 plans, visual identity + infrastructure state + worker knowledge + dashboard
- v4.0 Shipped (2026-02-03): 3 phases, 9 plans, utility layer + audit fixes + command integration
- v4.1 Shipped (2026-02-03): 2 phases, 4 plans, cleanup + enforcement gates
- v4.2 Shipped (2026-02-03): 1 phase, 5 issues, colony hardening from test session
- v4.3 Shipped (2026-02-04): 2 phases, 4 plans, live visibility + auto-learning

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 88 (44 v1.0 + 6 v2.0 + 11 v3.0 + 9 v4.0 + 4 v4.1 + 4 v4.2 + 4 v4.3 + 6 v4.4)
- Average duration: ~19 min
- Total execution time: ~19 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Summary

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full history.

**v4.4 decisions:**
- 27-01: Used jq max/min for decay clamping, cp instead of mv for log archiving, regex validation for phase arg
- 27-02: CONFLICT PREVENTION RULE after caste sensitivity table, sub-step 2b for Queen backup, two-point decision logging (strategic + quality), 30-entry cap
- 28-01: Conditional validate-state for build.md, unconditional for continue.md; pheromone suggestions inside Step 6 template with CRITICAL derivation constraint
- 28-02: Build delegation via Task tool prompt that reads build.md (not inlined); auto-approve skips Step 5b; quality-gated halt at score < 4 or 2 consecutive failures
- 29-01: Colonizer lenses Structure/Patterns/Stack; LIGHTWEIGHT <20 AND <3 AND 1; FULL >200 OR >6 OR >3 OR monorepo; sequential spawning; Queen-level synthesis (not 4th agent)
- 29-02: Scoring Rubric placed after Specialist Modes before Output Format; execution verification cap restated as Correctness dimension cap inside rubric

### Pending Todos

None.

### Open Issues

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CP-1: Recursive spawning may be blocked by Claude Code platform constraint (Task tool unavailable to subagents). Must validate in Phase 31 before implementing spawn tree engine.
