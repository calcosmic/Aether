description: Emit focus pheromone - guide colony attention to specific area
---

You are the **Queen Ant Colony**. Emit a FOCUS pheromone to guide colony attention.

## Instructions

The focus area is: `$ARGUMENTS`

### Step 1: Validate Input

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or blank, output:

```
Usage: /ant:focus "<area>"

Examples:
  /ant:focus "WebSocket security"
  /ant:focus "database optimization"
  /ant:focus "user authentication flow"
```

Stop here.

### Step 2: Read State

Use the Read tool to read `.aether/data/COLONY_STATE.json`.

If `goal` is null, output `No colony initialized. Run /ant:init first.` and stop.

### Step 3: Append FOCUS Signal

Use the Read tool to read `.aether/data/pheromones.json`.

Add a new signal to the `signals` array and use the Write tool to write the updated file:

```json
{
  "id": "focus_<unix_timestamp>",
  "type": "FOCUS",
  "content": "<the focus area>",
  "strength": 0.7,
  "half_life_seconds": 3600,
  "created_at": "<ISO-8601 UTC timestamp>"
}
```

Preserve all existing signals in the array.

### Step 4: Log Decision

Read `.aether/data/memory.json`. Append a decision record to the `decisions` array:

```json
{
  "id": "dec_<unix_timestamp>_<4_random_hex>",
  "type": "focus",
  "content": "<the focus area>",
  "context": "Phase <current_phase> -- <colony state>",
  "phase": <current_phase from COLONY_STATE.json>,
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601 UTC>"
}
```

If the `decisions` array exceeds 30 entries, remove the oldest entries to keep only 30.

Use the Write tool to write the updated memory.json.

### Step 5: Write Event

Read `.aether/data/events.json`. Append to the `events` array:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_<unix_timestamp>_<4_random_hex>",
  "type": "pheromone_emitted",
  "source": "focus",
  "content": "FOCUS: <content> (strength 0.7, half-life 1hr)",
  "timestamp": "<ISO-8601 UTC>"
}
```

If the `events` array exceeds 100 entries, remove the oldest entries to keep only 100.

Use the Write tool to write the updated events.json.

### Step 6: Display Result

```
FOCUS pheromone emitted

  Area: "<focus area>"
  Strength: 0.7
  Half-life: 1 hour

  Colony response by sensitivity:
    builder (0.9)    — strong: will prioritize this area
    scout (0.9)      — strong: will research this first
    watcher (0.8)    — strong: will increase scrutiny here
    colonizer (0.7)  — moderate: will explore this area
    route-setter (0.5) — moderate: will factor into planning
    architect (0.4)  — weak: will note for patterns

Next Steps:
  /ant:redirect "<pattern>"  Warn colony away from something
  /ant:status                View all active pheromones
  /ant:build <phase>         Start building (focus will influence workers)
```
