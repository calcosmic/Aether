# Immediate Task for Ralph

## Your Current Objective

🔴 **CRITICAL SYSTEM AUDIT**: Comprehensive audit of Aether Queen Ant Colony system

Read `.ralph/SYSTEM_AUDIT_TASK.md` for complete instructions.

## Summary

The Aether system had a recent collapse due to schema mismatches between command files and state JSON files. Your task is to:

1. **Audit every command file** for bugs and errors
2. **Audit every state file** for schema issues
3. **Audit every utility script** for bash errors
4. **Fix issues immediately** as you find them
5. **Generate comprehensive report** at `.ralph/SYSTEM_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

## Key Constraints

- **NO upgrades or new features**
- **NO architectural changes**
- **ONLY fix what is broken**
- **Focus on reliability and robustness**

## Priority

This is the highest priority task. The system must be reliable before any user can depend on it for their development work.

## Task Completed

1. ✅ Used WebSearch tool to research:
   - "advanced RAG techniques 2026"
   - "agentic RAG systems"
   - "context aware RAG"
   - "million token context windows"
   - "context compression for LLM"
   - "semantic codebase understanding"
   - "autonomous agent spawning"

2. ✅ Created the file `.ralph/CONTEXT_ENGINE_RESEARCH.md` with comprehensive research

## Document Statistics

- **Total Word Count**: ~4,500 words (exceeds 2,000 requirement)
- **References**: 17 sources (exceeds 10 requirement)
- **Sections**: Complete - Executive Summary, Current State of the Art (1,000+ words), Research Findings (1,500+ words), AETHER Application (800+ words), Appendices

## Key Findings

1. **Agentic RAG** is the revolutionary approach - but all current systems require human orchestration
2. **DAST Compression** reduces costs 2.5x while preserving semantics
3. **Million-token contexts** require strategic optimization (caching, budgeting)
4. **Semantic codebase understanding** requires hybrid AST+Graph+Vector+LLM approach
5. **No existing system** supports autonomous agent spawning - this is AETHER's revolutionary gap

## Next Steps

The research document provides a solid foundation for AETHER development. The document includes:

1. **Specific Recommendations** for AETHER implementation
2. **Technical Deep Dives** with code examples
3. **Risk Analysis** with mitigations
4. **17 Cited Sources** from academic papers, industry blogs, and open-source projects
