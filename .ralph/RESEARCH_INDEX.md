## Revolutionary Achievement

### Task 1.5: Autonomous Agent Spawning

**Why This Matters**:
After extensive research, **NO existing system** has agents that autonomously decide when to spawn other agents. All current systems (AutoGen, LangGraph, CDS) require:
- Human-defined agent roles
- Human-defined workflows
- Human-defined spawning triggers
- Central orchestrators

**AETHER's Innovation**:
- Agents detect when they need help (capability gap detection)
- Agents decide what specialist to spawn (multi-factor decision framework)
- Agents coordinate with spawned specialists (semantic protocols)
- Agents learn from spawning decisions (evolutionary learning)
- Strong governance prevents runaway spawning (kill switches, budgets)

**Impact**:
This is not incremental improvement—this is paradigm shift from "humans orchestrate agents" to "agents orchestrate themselves."
