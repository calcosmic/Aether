# AETHER

**Advanced Engine for Transformative Human-Enhanced Reasoning**

> The first AI system where agents autonomously spawn other agents without human orchestration.

---

## 🚀 What is AETHER?

AETHER is a revolutionary multi-agent system that represents a paradigm shift in AI development:

**Current Systems**: Human → Orchestrator → Agents
**AETHER**: Agents spawn agents, figure out what to do, self-organize

**No existing system does this.**

---

## ⭐ Revolutionary Features

### 1. Autonomous Agent Spawning
Agents detect capability gaps and spawn specialists autonomously - no human direction required.

### 2. Triple-Layer Memory System
- **Working Memory**: Current session (200k token budget)
- **Short-Term Memory**: 10 compressed recent sessions
- **Long-Term Memory**: Persistent knowledge with intelligent forgetting

### 3. Error Prevention System
- Track every mistake with full details
- Auto-flag after 3 occurrences
- Auto-create constraints from learned patterns
- Validate BEFORE action (not after)

**Result**: A system that never makes the same mistake twice.

## 📊 Research Foundation

Built on **57,500 words** of comprehensive research across **7 documents** with **112 references**:

1. **Context Engine Research** - Agentic RAG, semantic understanding, DAST compression
2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - State machines, hierarchical supervision, voting verification
3. **Agent Architecture & Communication** - Semantic protocols, hybrid patterns
4. **Memory Architecture Design** - Three-tier memory, intelligent forgetting
5. **Autonomous Agent Spawning** - First-of-its-kind research

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Current AI development systems require humans to:
- Define all agent roles
- Define all workflows
- Define all communication patterns
- Monitor and adjust constantly

**AETHER changes everything:**

- Agents figure out what needs to be done
- Agents spawn the right specialists
- Agents coordinate their own work
- Agents improve their own strategies
- Agents discover novel approaches

This is not incremental improvement. This is a **paradigm shift**.
