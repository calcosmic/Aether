profile: default

# Caste-to-model mappings
# Models are routed through LiteLLM proxy at localhost:4000
worker_models:
  # High-complexity castes: planning, architecture, coordination
  prime: glm-5           # Complex coordination, strategic planning
  architect: glm-5       # Pattern synthesis, design decisions
  oracle: glm-5          # Deep analysis, foresight
  route_setter: glm-5    # Task decomposition, planning
  archaeologist: glm-5   # Historical analysis, pattern recognition

  # Implementation castes: code generation, building
  builder: kimi-k2.5     # Fast code generation, refactoring

  # Validation castes: testing, research, lightweight tasks
  watcher: minimax-2.5   # Validation, testing, verification
  scout: minimax-2.5     # Research, exploration, quick checks
  chaos: minimax-2.5     # Resilience testing, edge case probing
  colonizer: minimax-2.5 # Environment setup, exploration
