profile: default

# Caste-to-model mappings
# Models are routed through LiteLLM proxy at localhost:4000
worker_models:
  # Long-horizon reasoning castes: coordination, historical analysis
  prime: glm-5           # Long-horizon coordination, strategic planning (200K context)
  archaeologist: glm-5   # Historical pattern recognition across long timeframes

  # Planning and architecture castes: system design, decomposition
  architect: glm-5       # Pattern synthesis, documentation coordination (200K context)
  oracle: minimax-2.5    # Research, foresight, browse/search (76.3% BrowseComp)
  route_setter: kimi-k2.5 # Task decomposition, structured planning (256K context)

  # Implementation and validation castes: coding, testing, exploration
  builder: kimi-k2.5     # Code generation, refactoring (76.8% SWE-Bench, 256K context)
  watcher: kimi-k2.5     # Validation, testing, verification
  scout: kimi-k2.5       # Research exploration, can spawn parallel sub-agents
  chaos: kimi-k2.5       # Edge case probing, resilience testing
  colonizer: kimi-k2.5   # Environment setup, visual coding from screenshots
