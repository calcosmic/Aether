# Aether Colony — Project Rules

> This project uses Aether for AI-assisted development with coordinated agent swarms.

## Pheromone System (Steer the Colony)

| Signal | Command | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| FOCUS | `/ant:focus "area"` | Guide attention to specific area |
| REDIRECT | `/ant:redirect "pattern"` | Hard constraint — "don't do this" |
| FEEDBACK | `/ant:feedback "note"` | Gentle adjustment after work |

**Before builds:** Use FOCUS + REDIRECT to set direction
**After builds:** Use FEEDBACK to course-correct

## Key Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/ant:init` | Initialize colony for this project |
| `/ant:build` | Build current phase with worker swarm |
| `/ant:continue` | Advance to next phase |
| `/ant:status` | Check colony status |
| `/ant:plan` | View or generate project phases |
| `/ant:flags` | List blockers and issues |
| `/ant:seal` | Archive completed colony |

## Caste System

Workers are assigned based on task type:

| Caste | Role |
|-------|------|
| 🔨 Builder | Implementation work |
| 🔍 Scout | Research, discovery |
| 👁️ Watcher | Monitoring, observation |
| 🎲 Chaos | Edge case testing |
| 🔮 Oracle | Deep research |
| 🏗️ Architect | Planning, design |
| 👥 Auditor | Code review, quality |
| 📝 Chronicler | Documentation |
