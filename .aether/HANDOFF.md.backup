# Colony Session Paused

## Quick Resume
Run `/ant:resume-colony` in a new session.

## State at Pause
- Goal: "Sync Aether commands to global Claude and OpenCode config directories and ensure we have a system for this that works and doesnt cause confusion with other agents in other repos, it must be a bulletproof system"
- State: READY
- Current Phase: 5 — Implement Conflict Prevention System
- Session: session_1739452800_sync
- Paused: 2026-02-13T20:30:00Z

## Active Pheromones
None active.

## Phase Progress
- Phase 1: Establish Command Source of Truth [completed]
- Phase 2: Fix Claude Code Global Sync (Already Working) [completed]
- Phase 3: Fix OpenCode Strategy (Hub-Based Distribution Only) [completed]
- Phase 4: Implement Hash-Based Idempotency [completed]
- Phase 5: Implement Conflict Prevention System [pending]
- Phase 6: Document and Test the System [pending]

## Current Phase Tasks
- [ ] 5.1: Document namespace distinctiveness
- [ ] 5.2: Add namespace isolation verification

## What Was Happening
The colony has completed Phases 1-4 successfully:
- Phase 1: Established command source of truth (package-local)
- Phase 2: Verified Claude Code global sync works
- Phase 3: Accepted OpenCode requires repo-local setup (hub-based distribution)
- Phase 4: Implemented hash-based idempotency (files only copied when content changes)

Phase 5 is now starting - implementing conflict prevention to ensure 'ant' namespace is distinct from other agents' namespaces.

## Next Steps on Resume
1. Start Phase 5: Document namespace distinctiveness (ant vs cds vs mds vs st:)
2. Then verify namespace isolation - ensure no collisions with other agents
3. After Phase 5, advance to Phase 6: Document and Test the System
4. Run end-to-end sync tests (install, update, update --all)
