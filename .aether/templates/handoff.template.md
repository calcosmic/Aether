# Colony Session — {{CHAMBER_NAME}}

## A Colony's Rest

This colony has been entombed. Its work is complete, its story told.
What began with a goal has ended with a chamber — a place of quiet preservation.

**Chamber:** .aether/chambers/{{CHAMBER_NAME}}/

## Colony Summary

- Goal: "{{GOAL}}"
- Phases: {{PHASES_COMPLETED}} completed of {{TOTAL_PHASES}}
- Milestone reached: {{MILESTONE}}
- Entombed at: {{ENTOMB_TIMESTAMP}}

## Chamber Contents

Everything the colony built and learned rests here now:

- colony-state.json — Full colony state
- manifest.json — Archive metadata
- CROWNED-ANTHILL.md — Seal ceremony record
- pheromones.json — Pheromone signals
- activity.log — Colony activity history
- spawn-tree.txt — Worker spawn records
- dreams/ — Dream journal (if existed)

## Session Note

The active colony has been reset. The chambers hold what was.
The learnings have been carried forward to QUEEN.md — the next colony won't start from nothing.

When you are ready to begin again:

To start anew: /ant:lay-eggs "<new goal>"
To revisit what came before: /ant:tunnels
